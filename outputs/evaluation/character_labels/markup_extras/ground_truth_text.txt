Bridge Market in Onitsha.The market was shut down by regulatory and security agencies due to alleged trading in illegal drugs within a section known as Ogbo Ogwu.While condemning the sale of illicit drugs, Obi, in a statement on Monday via X, emphasised the need for fairness in the enforcement of the law.One unequivocally condemns such illicit drug trading activities and urges the government to take all necessary measures to eradicate the sale of fake itemsespecially drugsand legally prosecute the perpetrators for the health and safety of society, he stated.Their continued closure is severely affecting the livelihoods of millions, especially during this difficult period in our country, Obi wroteHe also called for transparency in the search of shops, urging authorities to involve store owners during inspections.The search should be conducted transparently, with store owners present while their shops are inspected and items removed by the law and due process, he advised.Recalling his tenure as Anambra governor, Obi shared his approach to handling similar situations.Whenever we encountered public health threats, we addressed them collaboratively and

been fighting each other since ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.Abubakar Shekau, a former idiosyncratic leader of JAS, had, in 2015, pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), making him the leader of ISWAP.However, ideological differences forced some top members of the group, including Habib Yusuf, the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, to fall out with Mr Shekau.The breakaway faction led by Mr Yusuf, otherwise known as Abu Musab al-Barnawi, went ahead to bear the name ISWAP with its operational bases in the islands and shores of the Lake Chad basin, restricting their brothers-in-arms to places like Sambisa and Mandara Mountain in Gwoza.The genesis of the infightingWhen the groups first split in 2016, the Islamic State tried all it could to reconcile them, but the negotiation failed majorly as a result of Mr ShekauTMs ideological stance, especially on who should be regarded as a kufar [apostate] and why they must be executed.That same year of the schism, the Islamic State officially recognised Mr Yusuf as the leader of ISWAP.related news a conservation group

prioritize the establishment of a Combined Maritime Task Force to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea.Speaking at the 38th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Tinubu expressed NigeriaTMs readiness to host the headquarters of the proposed task force in Lagos.Delivering NigeriaTMs position on behalf of the President, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, emphasized the urgent need for collective maritime security efforts."The time has come for the African Union Peace and Security Council to prioritise the creation of a Combined Maritime Task Force for the Gulf of Guinea.I wish to announce that Nigeria would like to host the headquarters of the task force in Lagos."Nigeria Signs Strategic Agreement with AUTinubuTMs call for a maritime task force coincided with NigeriaTMs signing of a landmark agreement with the AU to provide Strategic Sea Lift Services for peace support operations, natural disaster response, humanitarian actions, and personnel movement.NigeriaTMs Minister of Defence, Badaru Abubakar, signed the agreement, under which the Nigerian Navy will provide a vessel for these operations on a cost-recovery basis.The signing ceremony was witnessed by Attorney-General and Justice Minister Prince Lateef Fagbemi, Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ikechukwu Ogalla, and Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Muhammed Muhammed.Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, the AU Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, signed on behalf of the African Union.Regional Security and Counter-Terrorism InitiativesPresident Tinubu commended the AUPSC for adopting recommendations from a recent high-level security meeting, including the decision to upgrade NigeriaTMs National Counter-Terrorism Centre into a Regional Counter-Terrorism Centre.He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate for the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), which combats terrorism and violent extremism in the Lake Chad Region.Expressing concerns over LibyaTMs continued instability and its spillover effects on the Sahel, Tinubu urged the AU to support initiatives aimed at restoring law and order in the North African country."The Sahel cannot enjoy peace as long as Libya does not," he warned.He further highlighted the insecurity plaguing countries in democratic transition, including Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Gabon, calling for collective AU intervention.Push for African-Led Peace Operations and Economic StabilityTinubu advocated for leveraging UN Security Council Resolution 2719 to support AU-led peace operations and warned against the increasing involvement of extra-continental military forces, including private military contractors, in AfricaTMs security matters.The President also reaffirmed NigeriaTMs commitment to the African Standby Force, urging AU members to finalize the draft Memorandum of Understanding for its full operationalization.On economic matters, Tinubu backed the establishment of an African-led Credit Rating Agency (ACRA) to provide fairer and more transparent assessments of African economies, countering biases often observed in global rating agencies."An independent African-led rating agency will help provide fairer assessments of African economies and reduce the bias often observed in existing global rating agencies," Tinubu stated.He commended the African Union, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Finance for advancing the Africa Financing Stability Mechanism (AFSM), which aims to address rising borrowing costs, debt burdens, and limited access to affordable long-term financing."The establishment of the AFSM underscores the collective commitment of member states in addressing financial vulnerabilities and fostering economic resilience across the continent," he said.Tinubu concluded by emphasizing the importance of adopting the AFSM to strengthen financial stability and enhance AfricaTMs resilience against external economic shocks.The Bureau
