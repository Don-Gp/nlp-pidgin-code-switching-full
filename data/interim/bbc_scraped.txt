Pep Guardiola and im Manchester City side avoid wetin for be ogbonge embarrassment as dem manage to beat Club Brugge 3-1 for dia last match for di league phase of dis year Uefa Champions League.
Dis win help City finish 22 for di league table, just two places above di last qualification position, as dem manage to qualify for di play off stage to see weda dem fit reach di round of 16.
Guardiola boys manage only a disappointing 11 points wit only three wins and three draws for dia eight matches of di Champions League first round.
Meanwhile, Arne Slot and im Liverpool team finish on top of di league even though dem lose dia final match 3-2 against PSV Eindhoven for di Netherlands.
Barcelona 2-2 draw wit Atalanta mean say di Nou Camp side no fit take advantage of Liverpool loss to jump into first position; di Spanish giants finish second.
Arsenal also qualify automatically for di round of 16 after dem beat Girona 2-1 for Spain to finish third on di table.
Di same tin wit Aston Villa who beat Celtic 3-2 for Villa Park to occupy di last qualification position of eighth.
Altogether, three English teams, two Spanish, and one team each from Italy, Germany and France make am into di top eight wey be di automatic qualification position for di round of 16.
E shock many pipo say big names like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, Manchester City, and AC Milan no qualify automatically.
Below na how di league phase of di new Champions League format take end:
First, make we remind ourself of wetin di 36 league-phase teams dey aim for.
Those wey finish for di top eight go automatically progress to di last 16, wia dem go seed dem.
Dem go wait for di winners of di eight two-legged knockout play-off ties wey go feature di clubs wey rank from ninth to 24th.
Those wey finish between ninth and 16th dem go seed dem and dem go face teams wey dey placed 17th to 24th, wit di advantage of playing di second leg at home.
Di clubs 25th or lower don chop elimination and dem no go get entry to di Europa League.
Di play-off ties go take place mid-February, while di last-16 matches go happun for di first two weeks of March.
One of Uefa reasons for changing to dis format na to make ""every game count"".
Dem say di format ""go ensure say any result get di potential to dramatically change a team position, right up to and including di very last matchday"".
And so, e don play out wit only two dead rubbers (Sturm Graz v Leipzig and Young Boys v Red Star Belgrade) and 16 games wit something on di line.
E get several games wia both clubs dey battle for di same goal, like Manchester City v Club Brugge, Stuttgart v PSG, Brest v Real Madrid and Inter Milan v Monaco.
E fit lead to enjoyable mayhem for fans wit some teams potentially wey go dey affected by more dan 10 oda games. Aston Villa, for example, fit overtake six teams or 15 teams fit overtake dem (although not all 15) - including opponents Celtic.
Another reason Uefa give for the new format na to ensure more matches between di top teams in di initial stages of di tournament.
Dis year don see Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in repeats of three recent finals, and Barcelona play Bayern Munich, while Paris St-Germain don face Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.
Failing to qualify for di next round go hit teams financially.
Every club for di league phase go get 18.62m euros for participating, wit performance bonuses of 2.1m euros per win and 700,000 euros per draw.
Each position for di table dey worth 275,000 euros, too. So di team wey finish 36th earn dis much, 35th go claim 550,000 euros through to 9.9m euros for di table-toppers.
Teams wey finish first to eighth also go earn 2m euros bonus, while teams wey finish ninth to 16th go get 1m euros.
Uefa also introduce a ""value pillar"" wey go split di broadcast revenue. Dis again go increase depending on your finishing position for di league phase.
Dat na bifor dem take into account matchday revenue and oda factors.
In oda words, e dey costly to chop elimination early."

""And di baby mama accuse me say na sake of say im no give me di baby placenta na im make me no be her friend again. So I come dey think say if me no collect di placenta and Mohbad no hold am, so who come hold am? So I want to know who get di baby"" na wetin e tok.

Mike Elvis Tusubira na Ugandan motorcycle taxi rider wey dey live wit HIV since 2022, wen dem first diagnose am.
For am—one of di 1.4 million pipo for Uganda wey dey live wit HIV—USAID na lifeline. Di next three months, e say, na ""literally a matter of life and death.""
""Di stopping of all USAID projects don affect me psychologically. I no know wetin go come next. Wetin go happun to me?"" e tok.
""My counsellor tell me say e no longer dey di clinic. Wetin go happen to my pikin and partner?""
""I dey worried about my future. And actually, di future fit no dey dia. Becos no mosquito nets, no ARVs, no condoms, no services at all.""
Mike wife dey HIV-negative and she dey rely on PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis), a medicine wey dey reduce di risk of contracting HIV.
Since di abrupt shutdown, neither im nor im partner don replenish dia supply of di life-saving medicine. Di uncertainty, e say don already put a strain on dia relationship.
Uganda dey among di top ten recipients of USAID funds in Africa. According to US goment data (ForeignAssistance.gov), di kontri receive $295 million in health funding from di agency in di 2023 financial year—ranking third afta Tanzania ($337 million) and Nigeria ($368 million).
Uganda health sector dey heavily reliant on donor funding.
USAID support dia HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and leprosy programs. E also dey fund maternal and child health services and emergency health assistance. Foreign donors dey fund 70% of Uganda AIDS response.
Thousands of healthcare workers dey impacted by di USAID funding freeze.
Shamirah na clinician with Reach Out Mbuya (ROM)—a faith-based community organization wey dey provide medical and psychosocial support to pipo living with HIV in Uganda. She bin dey based at Kisenyi Health Centre IV, wey dey serve a densely populated slum in Kampala.
On average, she dey attend to 200 patients wit HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis daily. But after di stop-work order, all ROM-supported health workers bin dey laid off.
Now, di Tuberculosis Unit also dey silent. Di Orphans and Vulnerable Children section— wey also dey funded by USAID—too dey shut.
""We dey wait for di 90 days. So, dis compulsory leave, I no prepare for am,"" she tok.
""E dey so abrupt, we no get enough time to prepare. We no get a proper handover of evritin for di facility. We just stop working.""
Uganda Ministry of Health say dem dey explore ways to integrate essential services into routine healthcare to minimize disruptions.
""As such, contracted staff wey dey willing to continue to work in di spirit of patriotism as volunteers until we harmonize wit di United States, goment dey encouraged to contact di respective hospital directors or my office,"" na so one official statement from Health Permanent Secretary Dr. Diana Atwine tok.
Further south in Malawi, USAID-funded activities also don stop.
For Macro Mzuzu Clinic, a key provider of HIV services for di kontri northern region, di gates dey shut. Vehicles dey idle. No sign of activity.
According to local resident Eddah Simfukwe Banda, wey dey depend on di clinic for her antiretroviral treatment, di clinic don dey deserted since dem issue di stop-work order.
Even afta di US State Department issue a waiver on 28 January to allow di delivery of medicine such as ARVs, many clinics still remain closed.
Witout di critical staff wey dey coordinate USAID activities, distributing medicines don become a challenge.
Even wia services technically dey permitted to resume, many contracts remain uncertain. Health workers dey unsure of wetin dem fit and fit no do.
Di Trump administration plan to significantly reduce USAID staff by more dan 90%.
Atul Gawande, USAID former Global Health Assistant Administrator, post on X say di agency workforce go dey slashed from 14,000 to 294—wit only 12 staff assigned to Africa.
More dan 30 NGOs also dey severely impacted by di funding freeze.
Malawi receive $154 million from USAID health budget for 2023, wey make dem di 10th largest recipient for Africa.
Di kontri remain one of di poorest and most aid-dependent in di world. According to di World Bank, Malawi dey vulnerable to external shocks—including prolonged droughts, cyclones, and erratic rainfall. Disruption of dis magnitude for dia healthcare system present an ogbonge challenge.
Eddah Simfukwe Banda dey worried about her own fate—and dat of her sister-in-law, wey also dey rely on donor-funded medication.
""As pipo wey dey on ART treatment we get several options to dis case. One we get to pray as Malawians. Dose of us wey believe and depend on God say we get God wey dey open doors wen one dey closed,"" she tok.
Right to Care, anoda USAID-funded health provider, dey forced to suspend most of dia operations, including dia HIV outreach programs for LGBTQ+ individuals for northern Malawi.
One staff member describe di facility as ""semi-deserted,"" wit only a handful of personnel allowed through a small walk-in gate.
According to UNAIDS, di global outlook dey grim.
For 2023, e bin get 630,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide and 1.5 million new infections.
While infection rates don dey decline in di worst-affected kontris, di impact of di USAID shutdown fit reverse dis gains.
""If you take away dis major contribution by di United States goment, we expect say in di next five years, additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths go dey,"" UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima tell BBC Africa Daily podcast.
""8.7 million new infections go dey, 3.4 million additional AIDS orphans go dey. I no wan sound like a prophet of doom, but I get a duty to give di facts as we see dem.""
One major concern for health experts na drug resistance. According to Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), any interruption in HIV treatment fit get severe consequences.
""Any interruption to HIV services and treatment dey deeply distressing to pipo wey dey care and emergency wen e comes to HIV treatment,"" na so Tom Ellman, director of di South Africa Medical Unit at MSF Southern Africa tok.
""HIV medicines gatz dey taken daily or pipo go run di risk of developing resistance or deadly health complications.""
Byanyima echo dis concerns, sharing di words of a desperate patient:
""One pesin living wit HIV don describe am as, 'Di na death trap. Please tok to di American goment. Dis na death trap for us. If I no get my tablets next month and di following month, how much longer I get to live?'""
For decades, di US na im be Africa most significant public health partner.
Since di launch for 2003, di US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) don save more dan 25 million lives.
""In di past year, USAID give $8 billion of aid assistance to Africa. Seventy-three percent go to healthcare,"" Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya tell di BBC Newsday program on 29 January.
Health experts warn say replacing dis funding go dey extremely difficult.
African goments don make strides in reducing aid dependency. Kenya now dey fund nearly 60% of dia HIV response. South Africa dey cova almost 80%.
But for many low-income nations, debt burdens, climate disasters, and economic shocks dey make self-sufficiency nearly impossible.
Amref Health Africa CEO, Dr. Githinji Gitahi, warn say witout urgent action, global health security dey at risk.
""Dis go require African goments and Africa CDC to increase dia own funding, wey dey almost impossible under di current debt distress conditions,"" e tok.
""With accelerating outbreaks from climate change and human-environmental 'conflict,' dis go leave di world fragile and unsafe—not only for Africa but for evribodi.”"

''Di first time I see my daughter face, I forget all my pregnancy pain,"" Kinjal Lathi, from Ahmedabad in India tok.
""I cry, and also my husband.""
Until dat moment marriage and motherhood dey always feel like a distant dream for Kinjal becos she get beta thalassaemia major disease.
She need a blood transfusion evri two weeks and gatz follow a veri strict diet and medicine regime.
Added to her underlying health condition na di challenge to born a child in di first place and to carry am.
""E get risks for both mother and child wey dey involved. But I decide to realise my motherhood dream,'' Kinjal tok.
Kinjal do 36 blood transfusions during her pregnancy but eventually give birth to a healthy daughter on July 12 for 2019. She get a planned caesarean section birth wey dey designed to minimise any potential blood loss.
Even afta she give birth, di 25 year-old ""gatz undergo blood transfusion,"" she tok. She add say at one point she do transfusion and at di same time she dey breastfeed her newborn baby
Di blood disorder no dey inherited by her daughter.
Thalassaemia dey caused by faulty genes wey dey affect di production of haemoglobin wey be di protein for red blood cells wey dey carry oxygen around di body.
Pikin fit only dey born wit thalassaemia if dem inherit dis faulty genes from both parents.
So, if both parents get di faulty gene wey dey cause beta thalassaemia major, e get a one in four chance of each child say dem go dey born wit di condition.
Parents of a child wit thalassaemia na usually carriers, meaning say dem only get one of di faulty genes.
Kinjal successful pregnancy dey extremely rare, according to paediatrician Doctor Anil Khatri, member of di Gujarat State thalassaemia task force. E treat both mother and child.
So rare, in fact, na somtin wey im neva previously encounter for di last three decades as a doctor treating more dan 100 thalassaemia patients.
Worldwide e get around 270 million pipo wey get thalassaemia, according to di Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
Na devastating disease wey dey make patients weak, get short of breath, unable to work and cut dia life expectancy.
E get several different types of thalassaemia, including Hemoglobin H disease.
Dis fit dey divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias - beta thalassaemia major (TM) na di most severe version of di disorder, India get 100,000 -150,000 children wit TM, di highest number of cases for di world.
Some 10,000-15,000 Indian babies dey born wit di disease evri year.
To give birth to a baby in di first place dey harder for pipo wit thalassaemia, gynaecologist Doctor Uma Khatri, wey treat Kinjal, explain.
Repeated blood transfusions fit affect di hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenaline glands and secretion of hormones wey dey impact fertility.
Correctly balancing iron levels through transfusions also dey challenging and patients fit also end up wit too much iron circulating for dia blood.
During pregnancy, di volume of blood for your body increase and so also di amount of iron wey you need to support yourself and supply oxygen to your baby. ""Thalassaemia patients don increase iron due to repeated blood transfusions. Den normally dey take medicine to reduce dis but dem no fit give am during pregnancy as e fit affect di patient internal organs,'' Doctor Uma Khatri explain.
""Usually, we dey call pregnant women for a check-up once a month. We dey call Kinjal evri 15 days. Dis na first-time for us too,"" Khatri tok as she explain say sonography normally na monthly to monitor a baby growth during pregnancy.
Sake of di additional strain pregnancy fit put on Kinjal body, her husband Naveen Lathia dey understandably worried.
E say e dey ""afraid im go lose Kinjal for di process."" But following her insistence, despite di risks, she still wan get a baby so e begin to research. E no dey able to find a single oda case of a woman wit thalassaemia major giving birth to a healthy child. ""But afta I discuss am wit di doctor, I dey ready,"" e tok.
Afta di birth, doctors advise Kinjal to stick to home-cooked food and stay away from crowded places to reduce any risk of infection.
Dr Khatri say TM patients dey at higher risk of infection as dia vital organs like heart, kidneys, lungs fit don damage and weaken dia immune response.
Pre-marital testing of couples and pregnant women plus counselling sessions don become widespread across India wit millions wey dey take part.
Dr Anil Khatri advise Indian couples say bifor any marriage both partners gatz dey tested for genetic blood disorders. ""If both get thalassaemia minor, make dem avoid marriage if possible, as e mean say e get a one in four chance of dat couple to get thalassemia major pikin,"" e tok.
However, doctors advise say if couple wey dey expect pikin both get thalassemia minor, a prenatal test fit take place for utero - wen di foetus still dey for di mother womb - at eight to nine weeks old.
If dat test den show say di pikin go get thalassaemia major, den some couples fit choose to do medical abortion."

Marcus Rashford na one of di popular players for Premier League.
Im don make 426 appearances for Manchester United and im dey 12th for di club all-time scoring list wit 138 goals.
Di 27-year-old don win both di FA Cup and EFL Cup twice. Im also don win di Europa League. Im get 60 England caps.
Outside football, dem award am MBE for 2021 for im work around child poverty.
But now im career get as e be sake of tori wey dey fly up and down say im days for United dey numbered afta im coach drop am for di Manchester derby.
On 18 July 2023 United confam say Rashford don sign new contract wey go keep am for di club until 30 June 2028. Dis end all di tok-tok about im future as Rashford previous deal bin dey due to expire in 12 months and im already don dey linked wit a number of major European clubs.
Di move make sense. Rashford bin just score a career-best 30 domestic goals during di 2022-23 season and im still only be 25.
Afta three games witout a goal, im score di opener for wetin turn out to be a 3-1 defeat for Arsenal on 3 September.
Im no score again for anoda 13 games as United poor form under Erik ten Hag begin.
For January di coach drop Rashford for dia FA Cup trip to Newport County afta e miss training sake of illness afta im bin spend longer time pass wetin dem approve for am for one authorised trip to Belfast. Foto comot of am wia im dey enter nightclub wia im bin drink tequila.
Although Rashford score di first goal of Ruben Amorim reign afta only 81 seconds for Ipswich on 24 November, di new United head coach don admit say di central striker no be di 27-year-old best position. Although Rashford bin start three games and be substitute for three of Amorim first six games in charge.
But, crucially, im bin dey bench for di midweek Premier League trip to Arsenal and di home game wey follow against Nottingham Forest on 7 December. Im start for di Europa League against Vitoria Plzen on 12 December but dem replace am afta 56 minutes wen United dey 1-0 down. Dem go on to win 2-1.
Dem drop am along wit Alejandro Garnacho for di Manchester derby. Afta di game, Amorim explain why: ""Di performance for training, di way you eat, di way you push your team-mates - evritin dey important for di beginning of somtin. Wen pipo for your club dey lose dia jobs, we gatz put di standards really high.""
At some point, evri manager get to make big calls. weda you like am or not, di outcome go end up to be how pipo see am .
Sir Alex Ferguson time for United dey littered wit major decisions - from axing Paul McGrath and Norman Whiteside but keeping Bryan Robson for di start of im reign, to letting Paul Pogba leave at di end.
Amorim know exactly wetin di fallout go be from im decision to leave Rashford out.
If United bin lose for Manchester City, pipo for ask many questions about di wisdom of just having only Joshua Zirkzee for bench as attacking player. But dem no need to. Thanks to Amad Diallo, dem win.
""Today we prove say we fit leave anybodi out and win,"" Amorim tok afterwards. Dat na big stick to take beat im players.
Rashford na realist. Im go know di hand writing for wall for am. E dey fair to say for di past 18 months - or for all but di 2022-23 season since November 2021 im score only twice for im last 28 appearances of di campaign wey Ralf Rangnick end in charge - im form dey below di standards of wetin im dey capable of.
Many pipo don criticise am well-well for im work ethic - and by some for im off-field behaviour, wey include trip to United States during di November international break.
Although some pipo dey argue say di way dem dey single out Rashford no fair. But dat side of im life no go change. Im need to deliver - and many times, im no dey deliver.
Rashford na one of United highest earners, im basic wage reach £300,000 a week. Only a small number of clubs fit afford dat salary and, for a variety of reasons, some of dem no dey market.
For Spain, evribodi know Barcelona financial issues. Real Madrid already struggle to find di right attacking combination from Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham.
Atletico bin pay big money to Manchester City for Julian Alvarez just bifor di summer transfer deadline.
For England top clubs, Manchester City and Liverpool na a bit of a stretch, even wit City poor form. Arsenal need a central striker - and Rashford no like to play dia. Chelsea dey like dem don spend enough. Tottenham dey inconsistent but e dey hardly likely for dem to drop dia skipper Son Heung-min, wey dey play for left.
Many times pipo don mention Paris St-Germain as a possible destination on a number of occasions down di years, but di French giants don always comot dia bodi from dat kain tok.
United don previously dey linked wit Randal Kolo Muani. However, even a swap deal dey questionable sake of say Rasmus Hojlund don impress as Amorim first choice for di lead attacking role.
Di Saudi Pro League fit make a big statement by signing such a recognisable figure from di Premier League wey be 27years. However, di feeling na say Rashford no buy dat kain plan.
A loan involving some kain wage contribution dey possible. But United don repeatedly speak of dia tight profit and sustainability rules (PSR) situation, as well as dia commitment to abide by di rules, so paying to let a high earner play for someone else go dey counter-productive.
Anybodi wey dey old enough to remember di Wayne Rooney saga from October 2010, wen im drop in a transfer request, wey Ferguson publicly finish am. And den go on to sign a new contract, all within less dan a week, go know say notin dey impossible for United.
Dis mata get three main points.
First one, na weda Rashford go meet Amorim demands? Dat, really, go be di easy bit - certainly di effort suppose dey non-negotiable. I dey tok about di effort Amorim dey demand, no be wetin di social media observers tink.
Second one, na if, im go fit di system? Dis part dey a bit more tricky. Rashford like to play wide and cut in. But no slot for dat for Amorim system.
Di coach don already tok say Rashford no dey ideally suited for a typical number nine role, wey go leave am wit either wing back (unlikely) or inside forward.
Di inside forward go require a lot of work, wey United no get wit dia current schedule. But if Hojlund dey hold di ball up, using Rashford pace to run na a viable alternative.
If Amorim want im team to dominate possession, e dey less valuable, especially if dem dey move into a higher area for pitch on a more consistent basis.
Di third option na to accept make di team dey use am as impact substitute. As Rashford dey approach di peak point of im career, going down dat route dey difficult to see am happun."

""Abeg help us,"" na di message wey dem write on piece of paper wey two girls hold up through di window of one room for di luxury Decápolis hotel for Panama City.
Di hotel offer dia clients rooms wit sea views, e get two exclusive restaurants, swimming pool, spa and private transportation. But di hotel don become ""temporary custody"" centre wey dey house 299 migrants wey dem deport from di US, di Panamanian goment tok on Tuesday.
Some migrants raise dia arms and cross dem at di wrists to show say dem dey deprive dem of dia freedom. Odas hang small sign wit messages such as: ""We no dey safe in our kontri.""
Dis migrants, dey part of di undocumented pipo wey Trump administration deport from di US, dem arrive for Panama on three flights last week.
President José Raúl Mulino recently agree say Panama go become di ""bridge"" kontri for deportees wey dem force to comot from US.
Howeva, di 299 migrants - from India, China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Vietnam, Turkey, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - only 171 don agree to return to dia kontris of origin.
Di remainder dey face more uncertain future.
According to di Panamanian goment, dem go transfer dis group to camp in di province of Darién, wey don temporarily house migrants wey dey cross di jungle to di US.
Bifor tourists fit enta and leave di hotel wit ease, but now heavily armed members of di Panamanian National Aeronaval Service don enforce strict security measures inside and outside di building.
From di street, pipo dey hang di clothes wey dem wash for window. One of di items na yellow Lakers basketball jersey wit di number 24, wey legendary player Kobe Bryant don wear.
For anoda window, one group of adults and three children don raise dia arms wit dia thumbs for dia palms - di international symbol for pipo wey need assistance. ""Help us,"" dem write am in red letters on di glass.
Two minors wey cover dia faces hold up sheets of paper against di glass wit di message: ""Abeg save di Afghan girls.""
One Iranian woman wey dey live for Panama for some years tell di BBC say she dey in contact wit one of di migrants wey dey inside di hotel and dem dey ""fear"" say dem fit return to Iran.
She tok say wen she enta di hotel to offer help as Farsi translator, dem tok say dem don already help dem, although according to sources wey dey inside di hotel, e no be true, she tok.
Using hidden mobile phone, since di contact wit pipo wey dey outside of di Decápolis hotel reportedly no dey allowed, di Iranian woman tok say migrant tell her say ""several minors dey trapped"" for di hotel, wey dem don deny lawyer and dem no allow dem to comot from dia rooms even to go chop.
Afta di media first report di story of di deportees on Tuesday, security measures put in place dey tight and dem don cut migrants access to di internet, di Iranian woman tok.
Di BBC contact both di Decápolis hotel and di Panamanian goment to inquire about di conditions wey dem hold di migrants down, but dem neva send any respons.
Howeva, di Minister of Public Security of Panama Frank Ábrego tok say migrants no dey allowed to comot from di hotel say im goment must guarantee di safety and peace of di Panamanians.
Video wey dem post on social media on di weekend show one of di migrants wey describe for Farsi how dem detain dem afta dem cross di border to di US and tell dem say dem go take dem to Texas, but end up in Panama.
Di woman in di video insist say dia lives dey in danger if dem return to Iran becos of possible attack of di goment.
Her intention, she tok say, na to seek political asylum.
Analysts say dis go dey difficult to obtain witout access to lawyer - even more so wen di Panamanian goment don announce dem no go offer di access to deportees.
On Tuesday, Ábrego say di migrants go remain temporarily for Panama unda di protection of di kontri authorities.
""Wetin we agree wit di US goment be say dem dey here and go remain for temporary custody for dia protection,"" e tok.
E also warn say pipo wey migrants wey no wish to return to dia kontri of origin go need to choose third kontri.
In dat case, e say, di International Organization for Migration (IOM) and di United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) go dey responsible for dia return.
Ábrego tok say di migrants dey live for Decápolis hotel becos of im capacity to receive dem.
Anoda senior official tok say ""dem no dey expect di arrival of more migrants"" becos no more flights.
Panama don gree to be ""bridge"" kontri for deportations afta di visit of di US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to di kontri amid tensions ova Trump threats to ""recover"" sovereignty of di Panama Canal.
One IOM tok-tok pesin tell di BBC say di organisation wey dey charge of ""providing essential support"" to pipo wey dem deport from di US.
""We dey work wit local officials to help pipo wey dey affected, supporting di pipo wey voluntary wan return and identifying safe alternatives for odas,"" e tok.
""While we no get direct involvement in di detention or restriction of movement of pipo, we dey committed to ensuring say dem dey treat all migrants wit respect and in accordance wit international standards,"" e tok.
Muzaffar Chishti, senior researcher for di Migration Policy Institute - think tank in di US - tok say many of di deportees dey come from nations wey no dey open to accepting di return of nationals wey dem deport from di US.
""By sending dem to Panama, di US no dey for di foto,"" e tok. ""Na headache for Panama to take charge of di negotiations and see how dis kontri go agree to take dem again.""
Dis week, flight wey dey carry deportees from di US go arrive for Costa Rica, anoda Central American kontri wey don agree wit Washington to become ""bridge"" on di path of migrants on uncertain journey.

Oga Musk na close adviser to US President Donald Trump, on Sunday Trump threaten to cut all future funding to South Africa ova allegations say dem dey collect land and ""dem dey treat certain classes of pipo very badly"".
Di South Africa-born tech billionaire put mouth for di quarrel wen im ask on X why Ramaphosa get ""open racist ownership laws"".
Ramaphosa office say for di call to Oga Musk di president ""reemphasize South Africa constitutional values wey torchlight di respect for di rule of law, justice, fairness and equality"".
Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa sign into law one bill wey go allow land seizures without compensation for certain circumstances.
Land ownership mata na long and serious issue for South Africa, most private farmland na white pipo get am, 30 years afta di end of di racist system of apartheid.
Many pipo don tell di goment to address di land reform and deal wit di past injustices of racial segregation.
For im earlier response to Trump, di South Africa president say im ""goment no kolobi any land"".
On Sunday, Trump write on im social media platform Truth Social: ""I go cut off all future funding to South Africa until di full investigation of dis situation complete!""
Im later tok, for one briefing wit tori pipo say, South Africa ""leadership dey do some terrible tins, horrible tins"".
""So dat dey under investigation right now. We go decide, and until such time wen we find out wetin South Africa dey do — dem dey take land and kolobi land, and actually dem dey do things wey perhaps dey far worse dan that.""

Di Natives Land Act bin leave vast majority of di land under di control of di white minority and set di foundation for di forced removal of black pipo to poor homelands and townships for decades until di end of apartheid three decades ago.

But until di recently passed law, goment bin only fit buy land from dia current owners under di principle of ""willing seller, willing buyer"", wey some pipo feel say don delay di process of land reform.
For 2017, one goment report say di farmland wey dey di hands of private individuals, 72% na white-pipo get am. According to di 2022 census white pipo make up 7.3% of di population.
However, some critics dey fear say di new land law fit get disastrous consequences like e happun for Zimbabwe, wia seizures wreck di economy and scare away investors."

""Di first time di doctor tell me say, I go dey poopoo from my stomach, e no really explain wetin e mean to me"".
Na so 21-year-old Oluwasina Tobiloba Elizabeth wey be Rectal Signet Ring Adenocarcinoma survivor tell BBC Pidgin.
She share her tori for one interview wia she dey emotional, cry as she remember her journey to survive di cancer.
Dem diagnose Tobiloba wit Rectal Cancer, Adenocarcinoma for March 2022.
Di first tin her doctors bin do den na surgery. ""E just tell me say I go dey pass out waste product from my stomach.

During di first surgery, doctors no dey able to remove di tumour for Tobiloba bodi sake of di size.
""Di tumor big sotey, e attach imsef to plenti organ for my bodi, so e go cost me my life to penetrate.""
She say doctors den bring out machine to do colostomy for her.
Colostomy na surgery to create opening for di colon (large intestine) through di belle. According to John Hopkins medecine, colostomy fit be short-term (temporary) or long-term (permanent).

Di mineral-rich east of di Democratic Republic of Congo don dey affected by conflict for more dan 30 years, since di 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Plenty armed groups don compete wit di central authorities to gain power and control of di potential fortune for dis vast nation.
Di instability affect neighbouring kontris well-well for di 1990s wen two huge conflicts, wey dem call Africa World Wars, lead to di death of millions of pipo.
Afta one rapid advance for di region, fighters from di M23 rebel group don take control of most part of Goma – one major city of more dan one million pipo for di east of DR Congo.
Goma, wey lie for di foot of one volcano near Lake Kivu, dey share border wit Rwanda.
Goma na di capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and na important trading and transport hub wey dey close to mining towns wey dey supply metals and minerals in high demand like gold, tin and coltan, wey be key component of mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.
Goma also na di base for di UN largest peacekeeping mission.
Di city don also become safe place for pipo wey dey run from di fight-fight between M23 fighters and di army wey start again for late 2021 – as di population don increase to around two million.
Di rebels tok say dem dey control di city, although reports dey say dem still dey face small-small resistance.
UN aid agencies don warn of major humanitarian crisis, as casualties don full hospitals and bodies lie down for streets.
Ethnic Tutsis na dem dey lead di M23. Dem say dem need arms to protect di minority group.
Di rebels tok say most of di previous deals to end di fighting no dey respected – Di group get dia name from one peace agreement wey dem sign on 23 March 2009.
Shortly afta dia creation for 2012, di M23 bin rapidly gain territory and seize Goma – actions wey receive international condemnations and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.
Dem force dem to withdraw from Goma, and dem suffer series of heavy defeats for di hands of di Congolese army plus one UN force wey ensure say dem force dem comot di kontri.
M23 fighters later agreed join di army but wit promises say Tutsis go dey protected.
But for 2021, di group bin take up arms again, as dem say goment break and no honour di promises.
Neighbouring Rwanda in di past don consistently deny say dem dey support M23, but for 2012, UN experts bin accuse Rwanda of providing weapons, logistical support and say na dem even dey command di rebels.
DR Congo goment, di US and France, don also identify say Rwanda dey back di group.
Last year, one UN experts report tok say up to 4,000 Rwandan troops dey fight alongside di M23.
For inside one statement on Sunday, Rwanda no openly deny say dem dey back M23, but instead dem say di fighting wey dey near dia border na ""serious threat"" to dia ""security and territorial integrity"".
Rwanda add say pipo dey use di kontri as scapegoat as dem blame di recent fighting on di Congolese authorities, dem say di authorities don refuse to dialogue wit di M23.
One peace process, wey Angola facilitate wey involve Rwanda and DR Congo, bin result inside ceasefire deal last year, however e no last and di fighting start again.
Dem fit partly trace di origin of di current fighting back to di genocide for Rwanda for 1994.
Ethnic Hutu extremists bin kill about 800,000 pipo –majority of dem from di Tutsi community.
Di genocide bin end wit di advance of one force of Tutsi-led rebels wey Paul Kagame, who be di president now bin command.
Fearing retaliations, an estimate of about one million Hutus bin run across di border to wetin now be DR Congo. Dis fuel ethnic tensions as one marginalised Tutsi group for di east – di Banyamulenge – bin feel increasingly under threat.
Rwanda army invade DR Congo two times, dem tok say dem dey go afta some of those wey dey responsible for di genocide. Dem work wit members of di Banyamulenge plus oda armed groups.
Afta 30 years of conflict, one of di Hutu groups, di Democratic Forces for di Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), wey include some of those wey dey responsible for di Rwandan genocide, still dey active for eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda describe di FDLR as ""genocidal militia"" and dem say dia continued existence for DR Congo east na threat to dia own territory.
Dem accuse di Congolese authorities of working wit di FDLR – accuse wey DR Congo deny.

Manchester City bifor now get record of losing four out of 105 premier league games under Guardiola wen dem don dey lead at halftime – dem win 94 wey dey draw seven.
Guardiola tok afta di game say ""I no dey good enof. Na me be di boss. I gatz to find answers, but so far I no find solutions. Dis na reality.""
""I neva get anytin to say. I get no defence. Manchester United don push well well. For two seasons, we neva lose 8 games. We no fit defend dat kind record,"" Pep tok Match of di Day.

Dia champions league dream also dey shake afta dem lose vs Juventus for Turin.
Di Manchester City team don grow old togeda. Dia hunger for success don vanish wey dia opponents now fit dey challenge dem until di final whistle like wetin Manchester United do for di Etihad.
Di way United fit snatch di victory bin vex Guardiola, but di Spanish manager no fit use injuries as excuse – like Rodri, John Stones and odas.
City gat to rebuild but e no go be easy.
Wetin dey in front of Guardiola na ogbonge job, sake of every defeat don dey show di work wia Pep gat to do wit dis team.

Im dey grow wey di Belgian bin dey get plenti injuries – e dey difficult to see say im go dey City next season.

Elon Musk children don go some kain places wey many no go ever fit see.
From meetings wit foreign leaders to control room of SpaceX launch, Musk pikin dem dey always show as constant sidekicks to dia papa work for tech, business and now, politics.
Dem don show plenty times for di United States capital since President Donald Trump tap di tech billionaire and Tesla co-founder to lead di newly-formed Department of Government Efficiency.
Musk four-year-old, ""Lil X"", hang for one corner of di Resolute desk for di Oval Office on Wednesday, im bin wear one brown pea coat and shirt wey get collar.
On Thursday, X and two of im siblings exchange gifts wit India Prime Minister Narendra Modi as dia papa dey discuss technology and innovation wit di foreign leader.
Even bifor im go Washington, e common to see Musk wit im children - for one meeting wit president of Turkey, one memorial service for Auschwitz concentration camp, and one Time magazine ceremony wia dem bin name am di 2021 pesin of di year.
""Di inclusion of di children for many public appearances na politician move or political move wey dey make am look like im dey a bit more personable (and) take human approach to how pipo for public dey take see am,"" Kurt Braddock, wey be American University professor of public communication, tok.
Still, Braddock tink say di decision to bring Musk kindergarten pikin to Oval Office dey unusual.
X bin look like say im dey bored during di 30-minute press briefing as im bin dey mimick im papa.
Di pikin bin sidon for floor and once, once, im go receive occasional side glance and smile from di leader of di free world.
At one point, e be like im tell someone for di room to ""shush"" dia mouth.
Oga Braddock say im believe say dia inclusion dey intentional - na distraction wey benefit both Musk and Trump.
""I dey tink am say, e get some kain strategy here trying to draw attention to some tins as dem dey divert attention to oda tins,"" im tok.
Jon Haber na strategic communication consultant wey don work wit five presidential campaigns and im dey teach for Harvard, im say Musk children making frequent appearances - and creating viral moments - dey beneficial for Trump.
""For Trump, di more chaos, di more im dey flood di zone, di less pipo go actually fit focus on. Chaos dey work for am,"" Haber tok.
Grimes, Musk ex-girlfriend and di mama of X, bin criticise her son appearance for Oval Office.
""Im no suppose dey for public like dis,"" she write for one post on X. ""I no see dis… but I dey glad say im bin dey polite. Sigh.""
For one 2022 Vanity Fair article, she say she no gbadun di idea say her pikin dey spotlight.
""Whatever dey go on wit family stuff, I just feel like children need to stay out of am, and X dey just dey out dia. I mean, I tink e dey really see am as protégé and to bring am to evritin and stuff.… X dey out dia. Na like so im situation just be. But, yeah, I no know.""
Long bifor politics, Musk dey allow im children follow body.
Ten yeas ago, wen im bin still dey build im profile and dey eager to draw attention to im electric-vehicle maker Tesla, e bin no dey unusual to see dem for events.
As analysts and reporters bin dey wait for di unveiling to begin for one Tesla facility for Silicon Valley for 2015, you go fit see im five children dey run through hallways as dem dey chase afta each oda and shrieking wit laughter.
Even though pipo bin dey forced to wait for hours for attendees, di presence of Musk children create atmosphere wey bin feel relaxed and even joyous.
Na departure from di stiff, far more formal events wey oda companies dey do wia di prospect of seeing executive veri young children go dey odd.
Musk get 12 children wit three different women.
Im most-recognised son, X Æ A-12?, dem dey call am ""Lil X"", di same letter wey Musk bin use to re-name Twitter wen im bin buy di social media company.
Musk imsef dey call di four-year-old ""emotional support human"".
Walter Isaacson, di author of Musk biography, say for di The Diary of a CEO podcast, Musk dey ""deeply committed"" to im children and dey ""almost obsessed by dem"".
""Wit im own children, im lovers, im wives, e get di same intensity wey dey baked into evritin wey im dey do,"" Isaacson tok.
""Im dey like to always get some of im children around am. Im dey always like to get companion, but dat no mean say im like calmness."""

Egyptologists don discover di first tomb of a pharaoh since dem uncover Tutankhamun own over a century ago.
King Thutmose II tomb na di last undiscovered royal tomb of di 18th Egyptian dynasty.
A British-Egyptian team locate am for di Western Valleys of di Theban Necropolis near di city of Luxor. Researchers bin tink say di burial chambers of di 18th dynasty pharaohs bin dey more dan 2km away, closer to di Valley of di Kings.
Di crew find am for area wey dey associated with di resting places of royal women, but wen dem enta inside di burial chamber, dem say e dey decorated - with di sign of pharaoh.
""Part of di ceiling bin still dey intact: a blue-painted ceiling with yellow stars on am. And blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars, na for kings' tombs dem dey find am,"" na so di field director of di mission Dr Piers Litherland tok.
E tell BBC Newshour programme say im bin feel overwhelmed in di moment.
""Di emotion of getting into dis tins na just one of extraordinary confusion becos wen you come across something wey you no expect to find, e dey emotional really,"" e tok.
""And wen I come out, my wife bin dey wait outside and di only thing I fit do na to burst into tears.""
Dr Litherland say di discovery don solve di mystery of wia di tombs of early 18th dynasty kings dey located.
Researchers find Thutmose II mummified remains two centuries ago but di original burial site bin never dey located.
Thutmose II na ancestor of Tutankhamun, wey im reign dey believed to dey from about 1493 to 1479 BC. British archaeologists find Tutankhamun tomb for 1922.
Thutmose II dey best known for being di husband of Queen Hatshepsut, regarded as one of Egypt greatest pharaohs and one of di few female pharaohs wey rule in her own right.
Dr Litherland say di ""large staircase and a very large descending corridor"" of di tomb suggest grandeur.
""E take us a very long time to get through all dat,"" e tok, noting say e bin dey blocked by flood, dirty and di ceilings bin don collapse.
""Na only after we crawl through 10m (32ft) passageway wey get small 40cm gap at di top na im we get into di burial chamber.""
Na dia dem discover di blue ceiling and decorations of scenes from di Amduat, religious text wey dey reserved for kings. Dat na anoda key sign say dem don find a king tomb, Dr Litherland tok.
Dem set to work clearing di dirty dem - expecting say dem go find di crushed remains of a burial underneath.
But ""di tomb turn out to dey completely empty"", Dr Litherland tok. ""Not becos e dey robbed but becos dem deliberately empty am.""
Dem come work out say di tomb bin don dey flooded bifor - ""dem bin build am underneath waterfall"" - just a few years after di king burial and move di contents to anoda location in ancient times.
Na through going through tonnes of limestone for di chamber na im dem find parts of alabaster jars, wey dem write di names of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut.
Dis pieces of alabaster ""bin probably dey broken wen dem bin dey move di tomb,"" Dr Litherland tok.
""And thank goodness say dem actually break one or two things becos dat na how we find out who get di tomb.""
Di artefacts na di first objects wey dem find wey dey associated with Thutmose II burial.
Dr Litherland say im team get a rough idea of wia di second tomb dey, and e fit still dey intact with treasures.
Di discovery of di pharaoh tomb cap off more dan 12 years of work by di joint team from Dr Litherland New Kingdom Research Foundation and Egypt Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
Di team bin don previously excavate 54 tombs for di western part of di Theban mountain in Luxor, and bin also establish di identities of more dan 30 royal wives and court women.
""Dis na di first royal tomb to dey discovered since di ground-breaking find of King Tutankhamun burial chamber for 1922,"" na so Egypt minister of tourism and antiquities Sherif Fathy tok.
""Dis na extraordinary moment for Egyptology and di broader understanding of our shared human story."""

Wen I first drive into DR Congo eastern city of Goma, e hard me to tell weda I don enter a conflict zone.
Goma residents full di streets a few miles from di border with Rwanda - commuters dey go work, hawkers dey sell goods by di roadside and taxi drivers dey hustle customers.
But e only take a few minutes to notice say a new ""goment"" dey town.
As I reach one checkpoint near a police post wey bin dey formerly run by di Congolese authorities, fighters wey carry gun from di M23 rebel group stop my car.
Last week, M23 bin capture Goma, eastern city of nearly two million pipo, after dem advance on DR Congo eastern region.
At least 700 pipo for di city dey killed and close to 3,000 injured as di rebels clash with DR Congo army and dia allies, according to di UN and di Congolese goment.
M23, wey dey made up of ethnic Tutsis, say dem dey fight for minority rights, while DR Congo goment say di Rwanda-backed rebels dey seek control of di eastern region vast mineral wealth.
For di checkpoint, M23 rebels look inside my car, ask my driver a few brief questions, den allow us to pass into di devastated city.
Di rebels no face opposition - e be like say dem always dey dia.
I make my way to one of di few hospitals wey dey treat wounded victims and as I enter, cries of pain dey echo through di corridors.
I meet Nathaniel Cirho, one medical doctor wey, in a strange role reversal, sidon for one hospital bed with a sling around im left arm.
Bomb bin land on di house next to am and Mr Cirho and as di house scatter, e scatter and hit neighbours.
""I sustain injury on my arm. One 65-year-old man get injury for im belle. After surgery, e no survive,"" e tok with regret.
Several wards away, one elderly woman lie down for anoda hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen tank.
She bin comot bullet from her own arm after heavy exchange of fire break out for her neighbourhood.
""Suddenly my hand feel cold, and I realise say dem don shoot me,"" she tok as she struggle to find her speech.
For days, she nurse di gunshot wound without help. She tell me say some M23 fighters eventually escort her to a public hospital.
Di woman ask make dem move her to a private hospital, wia she dey receive treatment, becos she bin no dey receive adequate attention from di overstretched doctors.
But even for dis second hospital, medics dey overwhelmed as an increasing number of patients dey come through di doors.
""We don treat most of dem becos we no get contingency plans,"" one doctor, wey no want call im name for security reasons tok.
E add say: ""On Sunday wen di fighting start, we receive 315 patients and we treat dem.""
But now, di hospital dey count over 700 patients with various degrees of injury, di doctor tell me.
E tok of receiving patients with ""gunshot wounds to di head, odas on di chest, stomach, hands and legs"".
As eastern DR Congo dey inside dia political palava, di UN Office of di High Commissioner for Human Rights don warn say rival parties dey use sexual violence as a weapon of war.
Di doctor for dis private hospital confam di UN statement, say im facility so far don receive about 10 victims of rape and gender-based violence.
Outside di hospital and into di city centre, di feelings dey mixed.
Pipo dey waka pass four vans wey bullet scatter, dem dey witness wetin happen wen dem dey take shelter for safety.
Although di gunfire and explosions for Goma don die down small, not all establishments dey back to business as normal. Some shops don open for some streets, but not for odas. Major banks also remain closed.
Perhaps some dey careful say anytin fit happen with di way di security situation for di wider North Kivu province dey.
""Pipo dey fear… I still dey fear becos those wey cause di tension still dey with us and we no know wetin dey go on,"" shop owner Sammy Matabishi tok.
""But di bad tin be say pipo no dey buy from us, many don go Rwanda, [di Congolese city of] Bukavu, Kenya and Uganda.""
E add say traders wey import goods from neighbouring countries no fit transport products into city.
Many residents I tok to say dem don come to terms with M23 running di place.
And as an outsider I fit see say di rebels wan establish dia control.
Dem don take over di office of di North Kivu military governor, wey dem kill as dem advance into Goma.
Fighters bin also dey present for strategic areas around di city, while odas dey patrol di streets on pickup trucks, with weapons for dia hand.
During di whole time I dey Goma, I no see a single active Congolese soldier.
I however, see abandoned trucks with ""FARDC"", di French acronym for di DRC armed forces.
Near di base of di UN peacekeeping mission (Monusco) - wey get di task of protecting civilians from rebel forces - military uniforms, magazines and bullets just dey anyhow across di road.
""Wen M23 arrive here, dem surround our army,"" Richard Ali wey dey live nearby, tell me.
""Many remove dia military uniforms, troway dia weapons and wear civilian clothes. Odas run away.""
As M23 dey rejoice over a major win, di Congolese goment continue to deny di rebels claim say dem don totally capture Goma.
Di authorities accuse M23 of illegally occupying dia land - with di support of Rwanda - and promise to recover any lost territory.
Although Rwanda bin dey consistently deny backing di rebels, dia response don shift to a more defensive one, wia goment tok-tok pipo say fighting near dia border na security threat.
Di rebels now dey reported to dey move south towards Bukavu, di capital of South Kivu, and dem vow to reach capital city Kinshasa.
For now, Goma remainsdia biggest coup. Conditions dia show wetin life fit become for many more Congolese pipo, if di M23 gain more ground.

US President Donald Trump don tok say e go cut all future funding to South Africa sake of accuse say di kontri dey take pipo land and dey treat ""certain classes of pipo very bad"".
Last month, President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa sign a new law wey allow goment to seize pipo land witout compensation in certain circumstances.
Land ownership for South Africa na controversial issue bicos na di oyibo pipo for di kontri still get most of di farmlands, 30 years afta di end of di racist system of apartheid.
Pipo bin don dey call on goment to address land reform and deal wit di past injustice of racial segregation.
On Sunday, Trump write on im social media platform Truth Social: ""I go cut off all future funding to South Africa until dem complete full investigation of dis situation!""
Later, wen e dey tok wit tori pipo, Trump say di South Africa goment ""dey do some terrible tins, horrible tins"".
""So dat one dey unda investigation right now. We go make a determination, and until we find out wetin South Africa dey do — dem dey take away land and dey confiscate land, and actually dem dey do tins wey dey perhaps far worse dan dat.""
In response, South Africa Minister for International Relations, Ronald Lamola, also write for X say im bin hope say Trump advisers go use ""dis investigative period to deepen dia understanding of South Africa policies as a constitutional democracy"".
""Such insights go ensure a respectful and informed approach to our democratic commitments,"" oga Lamola tok.
Di South African president say di goment neva confiscate any land.
For inside one statement, Ramaphosa say di new law no be ""confiscation instrument, but na constitutionally mandated legal process wey go ensure public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by di constitution"".
E say South Africa no dey receive any oda funding from di US except for di US aid programme Pepfar, wey represent ""17% of South Africa HIVAids programme"".
Di US bin allocate about $440m in assistance to South Africa for 2023, according to data from di US goment.
Di South African goment say di new law no allow anyhow seizures of land as dem must first try to reach agreement wit di owner.
Vincent Magwenya, di tok-tok pesin for President Ramaphosa explain last month say di state ""no go seize property anyhow or for a purpose wey no be ... in di public interest"".
E say di current system of ""willing seller, willing buyer"" dey allow white farmers to delay di process of land reform.
However, some critics don express fear say di law fit get disastrous consequences like e happen for Zimbabwe, wia land seizures bin scatter di economy and scare away investors.
Efforts to address di issue of land inequality for South Africa don cause criticism in di past, including from Elon Musk, who dem born for South Africa and wey now be one of Trump advisers.
""Why you get openly racist ownership laws?"" Elon Musk bin respond to Ramaphosa statement on X.
For 2018, for im first term as president, Trump bin ask di US Secretary of State dat time, Mike Pompeo, to study South Africa ""farm seizures and expropriations and di large scale killing of farmers""."

A visibly frustrated figure in di moments afta dem read out di scorecards, Fury tok for backstage say im dey convinced say e win di fight by ""at least three rounds"".
Di rematch wey dem call Usyk v Fury 'reignited', di two most technically gifted heavyweights serve up anoda classic and showcase elite level boxing.

Fury na enigma: a boxer wey be say even wen im refuse to engage wit di media or sell a fight as e do dis week - e dey able to emit a certain energy and draw in a crowd.
Anthony Joshua also dey at crossroads afta destructive defeat by Dubois. Now fit be di perfect time for di long-awaited all-British heavyweight tussle.
Meanwhile, Usyk fit rightly call di shots on im next move.
Dubois, wey Usyk stop last year, still get am for mind afta di referee decision to rule a punch wey drop di Ukrainian earlier in di fight as a low blow.
Usyk don also previously hint say e fit move back down cruiserweight. Di discipline e go take to lose di weight and recondition imsef dey indicative of a man wey dey forever chase greatness and new challenges.
Di Crimea-born fighter certainly get options, but di best of im era dey run out of credible opponents."

Many Nigerians surprise afta di National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) release di inflation figure for January 2025, wey show say inflation drop to 24.48% from di 34.4%.
Bifor dis latest figures, di inflation rate for Nigeria bin drop only once in 2024 and dat na for di month of July wen e drop from 34.19% to 33.4%; and e start to increase steadily again until di end of di year.
Dat na why di recent January figures by di NBS wey show a drastic drop of about 10%, take many pipo by surprise.
According to di NBS, dis development na sake of di rebasing wey dem do for di Consumer Price Index (CPI) wey be di main tool for measuring inflation.
""Di CPI be like basket and many goods and service wey Nigerians dey purchase on daily basis full inside. Rebasing di CPI means say we dey swap out di outdated items for dis basket and we dey fill am wit oda newer items wey reflect wetin pipo dey buy today, and e go make sure say our inflation calculations dey more accurate,"" di NBS tok.
Dem further explain say dis new CPI basket include 960 products, up from di 740 products wey bin dey di old basket.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) na index wey dey give a general measure of changes in di average prices of goods and services wey consumers dey mostly buy compared to a period of time wey dem dey call di base year or price reference period.
One of di key importance of dis CPI na say dem dey use am produce kontri inflation rate among oda tins.
CPI rebasing na exercise wen dem dey carry out to make sure say di methodological basis upon which dem dey construct di CPI dey strong, logical and consistent with best practices.
According to NBS, e specifically mean to bring di weight and price reference periods closer to di current period. (i.e di current consumption pattern). E go ensure say di inflation figure reflect current inflationary pressure and consumption patterns.
Di simple answer na no.
Na statistical process wey no directly get impact on di price of goods and service.
E dey only provide up to date measure of price change for di kontri.
Paul Alaje wey be ogbonge economist tok say di concept of rebasing mean say di NBS change di reference year wey dem bin dey use to calculate inflation.
Bifor now, di reference year wey di NBS bin dey use na 2009 but now dem decide to use 2024 as di reference or base year, Alaje explain for one interview wit Channels TV.
E further explain dat changing di reference year na best practice bicos two key decisions wey goment take recently - floating di naira and stopping fuel subsidy - bin get strong impact on di economy, so e no make sense to continue to dey use 2009 as di base year.
""But dat one no mean say if you go market, di price don reduce, or to say di quality of life for di ordinary pesin don improve, however, di numbers go help to improve di image of di kontri.
""Di only positive I fit give to dis, however, na di confidence wey dis new figures go bring to our economy in attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).
Anoda sabi pesin wey chook mouth for di matter, Uche Uwaleke, a professor of capital market for Nasarawa State University, agree say dis recent figures no exactly mean say prices of food or oda commodities don come down well-well, e go fit boost Nigeria ability to attract investors.
""Inflation na one number wey investors dey always look at bicos dem dey interested in di real rate of return on dia investment. So wen di inflation number reflect more accurately di inflationary pressure, e go put investors in a position to make a favourable decision,"" oga Uwaleke tok.
E add say im dey expect dis new inflation rate to also affect di decision of di Central Bank of Nigeria wen dem meet to discuss interest rates.
Meanwhile, one X user wey im handle na @ThaMVP say: ""E no be must say we go adopt methodology wey reflect international best practices but e no reflect di peculiarity of local events.""
Anoda person, Maurice Ekpenyong, tok say ""food inflation dey more dan 100% and you want us to believe say e don drop to 26.08%?""
@alabioloyde simply write: ""Dis (figures) no dey correct and e no get any way wey dis na di reality""."

Charity Muturi don dey fight suicidal thoughts since she dey 14 years.
For her 30s, di Kenyan bin dey diagnosed wit bi-polar disorder. But instead of to allow her thoughts to keep her quiet, she become ogbonge advocate for mental health.
Becos she sabi di kain shame and isolation wey conditions like di one wey she get dey cause, Charity bin work taya to carry di issue enta di goment eye to make sure say pipo wey dey in distress dey met wit care and not punishment.
Pipo wey sabi Charity call am say she dey selfless and unwavering, wey always dey give her time to help odas.
Her younger brother say ""like her name Charity, she bin dey full of love, very sacrificial and selfless"".
For 6 November last year, Charity die by suicide.
But her campaign to change how pipo dey see mental health for Kenya still dey on. Mental health campaigners say Charity work bin dey important to change di law around suicide for di kontri.
For January dis year, Kenya High Court declare Section 226 of di Penal Code wey make suicide crime, say e dey unconstitutional.
Bifor anybodi wey try to kpai demselves fit face two years for prison or fine or both. Pipo wey attempt suicide bin dey often arrested and prosecuted instead of dem to get mental health support.
January ruling wey Judge Lawrence Mugambi give find say di law wey punish pipo wit mental health issues dey go against dia right to healthcare.
Psychologist and mental health advocate Amisa Rashid, wey work togeda wit Charity say di ruling na victory for Kenyans and honour Charity work to make am come true.
She say, ""na very painful moment to pipo wey sabi am, dis go be her legacy"".
But Rashid say di struggle to bring wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues still dey go on.
She say, ""sometins dey wey we need to change wey include di societal, behavioural and attitude chage about suicide.,""
However, Rashid say di struggle to bring about wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues kontinue.
Di criminalization of attempted suicide get complex history.
For colonial times, many African colonies bin get law against suicide and even though many kontris don comot di laws, some don keep am afta independence.
For Ghana wia dem decriminalise suicide for 2023, mental health sabi pipo report say early signs of improved public look even though di deep-seated cultural beliefs still be challenge.
Dr Akwasi Osei, wey be di former chief executive of di Mental Health Authority of Ghana, tell di BBC say e fit dey ""too early to get documented evidence"" of complete change in attitudes about suicide mata, but e clear sat di move don lead to ""improved perception about suicide and attempted suicide"" for id kontri.
For Kenya, mental health professionals hope say di ruling go encourage pipo to find help witout fear say dem go face prosecution.
But many pipo still believe say di stigma wey surround suicide go continue until more efforts dey made to educate di public.
Dr Chido Madzvamutse, wey be mental health medical officer for di World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office say, ""decriminalization na step but we gatz move on to more open honest tok-tok about mental health generally. To change society attitude need education, awareness and compassionate support systems"".
For many African societies, suicide still be taboo.
Region and culture look am as immorality instead of health issue wey mean say di affected families no fit mourn come outside.
For Kenya, e no dey uncommon say di familes go hide wetin cause di death bicos of fear of stigma.
For some communities, dem no dey do traditional burial for pipo wey die by suicide and even di families fit face discrimination and isolation.
Dis cultural barriers dey make am hard for pipo to find support even wit di change of laws.
Religious leaders for many African kontris still dey against suicide attempts.
Archbishop Peter Ogunmuyiwa, wey be senior official for di Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) — one of di kontri largest religious groups say, only God get rght to take life for offence.
E say, ""one of di strong laws for Bible be thou shall not kill. Na abomination bifor God, sin wey no get any forgiveness at all especially wen dem do am on purpose.""
But Archbishop Ogunmuyiwa say exception fit dey made for clinically certified individuals wit confam mental illness.
Sheikh Ibrahim Lithome, wey be Kenyan Muslim scholar and di legal and religious advisor to di Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims say suicide no dey allowed for di Islamic faith.
E say, ""Life na Allah own and no one get right to destroy. No worldly punishment but ogbonge punishment dey for di afta life. For di pipo wey try suicide and survive also don commit sin"". E add say dem need ask for forgiveness.
E say di survivors need support not punishment, say dem need counselling and spiritual guidance so dem go fit find hope.
Even pass religion, Kenyan mental health advocate Amisa Rashid tink say cultural factors like language also get role to play for di stigma.
She explain say di Swahili word for psychosis mean ""mad pesin"". Dat kain word fit also isolate pipo wey get mental illness.
She say to change di local language for mental health fit help ginger empathy and understanding.
Ghana experience fit give ogbonge lesson to Kenya move.
Since dem decriminalize suicide, Ghana don launch national awareness campaigns and improve mental health services to encourage pipo to find help.
But di kontri still dey face limited mental health infrastructure and deeply held social stigma.
For Nigeria wia suicide still be criminal offence, advocacy dey work wit goment to change di law.
One National Taskforce on Decriminalization of Suicide bin dey launched for 2024 to fit submit bill give parliament within di year.
Sabi pipo for Nigeria say Kenya court ruling fit be inspiration for dat kain tin to happun for dia kontri.
Cheluchi Onyemelukwe, wey be chair of Nigeria taskforce say, ""dem give us one year, we don dey work based on our terms of reference. We dey hope say within dis year, dis kain tin go happun for us.""
Even though di ruling from Kenya High Court na ogbonge move, di kontri parliament gatz take action ot formally comot di law.
Mental health advocates want sharp-sharp legislative action to make sure say di ruling cause real policy change.
Di International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) dey work wit Kenyan partners to push for more reforms.
According to Katherine Thomson from IASP, decriminalization na di first step, but goment must to invest in mental health services and public education campaigns.
She say, ""Awareness for first responders; police, judiciary, community leaders and health care workers so dem go fit support pipo wit empathy and compassion. Media also get important role to how dem dey tok about suicides for news to support di shift for attitude.""
For advocates like Amisa Rashid, di memory of Charity Muturi na reminder of how continued advocacy dey important.
She say, ""Charity voice bin dey powerful bicos she bin dey tok from her life experience. We need dat spirit to stay alive and make sure say pipo wey get mental health issues dey di front of policy tok-tok"".

E add say e get need to remove di Hutu armed group Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo (FDLR) wey dey also operate for di North Kivu province for eastern DRC.
Di leaders for dis communiques also want make Rwanda stop im defensive measures, plus disengage all Rwanda forces from DRC.
Defence chiefs from member states don also get instruction to meet within five days to develop security plan for Goma and surrounding areas, and also to discuss di reopening of Goma Airport and key supply routes – including to facilitate delivery of humanitarian aid to eastern DRC.
Di heads of state want immediate ceasefire, and restoration of essential utilities, food supplies, and oda important commodities.
Political and diplomatic engagement na im be di best and sustainable solution to di conflict, leaders tok.
Kenyan President William Ruto – wey be chairmo of di EAC block, say fighting no fit bring solution to di complex and historical conflict for DR Congo.
Ruto also call M23 make dem stop dia progress and make Kinshasa stop im revenge attacks.
""Specifically, we stand togeda to call on all parties to actualise ceasefire, and specifically on M23 to stop further progress and armed forces of DRC to cease all revenge attack. Immediate ceasefire na di only way wey we go fit create necessary conditions for tk tok wey go give way forward and implementation of comprehensive peace agreement""
According to Ruto, DRC palava e complex, delicate, don too tey, and involve plenty actors wey dey pursue different interests.
DR Congo wahala no no be today e start, and no be mata wey concern only di kontri, e don dey go on for many many years.
Ruto say e get ""one kain underground international dimension, wey dem no fit to ignore im determination, doubtful and destructive effects any longer.
Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan wey host di regional summit say make regional leaders try find solutions to di conflict, beacos im dem fail, history go judge dem harshly.
""As regional leaders, history go judge us harshly if we sidon dey look di situation dey get worse day by day. And in line wit di philosophy of African solutions for African problems, our kontris get collective responsibility to make sure say we urgently address di existing insecurity challenges wey don heavily affect di life of innocent civilians""
Currently, two different peace negotiations naim dey go on, one for Luanda capital of Angola and Nairobi, capital of Kenya but di summit say dem want make di combine di two togeda to become one Nairobi-Luanda process, so di two go fit complement each oda.
Plenty African kontris don send di army go eastern DR Congo as M23 rebels don seize plenty of di mineral-rich land for di region.
DR Congo big no be small. Di kontri wey be two-thirds di size of Western Europe get long history of outside interference.
So, who be di main players and wetin dey want?
Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi wan regain di territory wey im kontri lost to di rebels, including di largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent dem from seizing more.
Im dey blame Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing M23 wit weapons and troops, wit di aim of stealing di kontri mineral wealth and to change regime.
Im claim say Rwanda dey support M23 rebels na base on evidence inside one UN report wey many African and Western goments believe. And dem don demand make Kagame withdraw im forces.
But to Tshisikedi frustration, notin don happun.
Di Congolese leader dey also worry about keeping im seat.
""I tink di political survival of im goment dey at stake,"" Jason Stearns, one former UN investigator for DR Congo and current professor for Simon Fraser University, tok.
Rwanda long-time leader Kagame dey di centre of dis conflict, but im sabi dodge.
E also get long history of military intervention inside DR Congo wey get connection to di result of di 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Rwanda no gree say e dey provide military support to M23, but dey always tok say e go do anything necessary to defend imsef.
Kagame insist say Rwanda priority na to destroy one armed group wey Hutu genocide perpetrators, wey massacre Rwanda Tutsis, come run go wia now be eastern DR Congo.
E accuse DR Congo army of joining forces wit dem and odas not just to slaughter Congolese Tutsis - wey M23 claim say dem dey fight to protect - but to threaten Rwanda.
For diplomatic level, Rwanda want confirmation of im tori say di fight na Congolese problem, and Kigali just dey defend im borders against spill-over of di civil war.
Rwanda want make Kinshasa negotiate directly wit M23, Kinshasa refuse.
But wetin Rwanda really want according to Oga Stearns, na ""to maintain influence for eastern DR Congo"".
Rwanda get both economic and security interests.
Kigali deny UN evidence say e dey smuggle plenty gold and oda metals out of eastern DR Congo and sell dem as im own.
But access to DR Congo mineral wealth n aim di koko of conflict for many years.
Rwanda dey see Burundi army as anoda security threat for eastern DR Congo.
Di kontri wey get borders wit both Rwanda and DR Congo don get thousands of soldiers dia for years.
Dem bin to hunt Burundi rebels but now dem dey support Kinshasa army to fight M23.
Relationship between Rwanda and Burundi dey hostile.
Di two kontris get similar tribes, but unlike Rwanda, di majority Hutus na dem dey rule for Burundi.
Di two kontris don dey accuse each oda of trying to overthrow each oda goment.
Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye bin post very strongly-worded warning on social media.
""If Rwanda continue to make conquests,"" im wrote, ""I know say war go even arrive Burundi… One day im [Kagame] go wan come to Burundi – we no go accept dat. Di war go spread.""
Dis threat go continue if M23 continue im takeover from Goma enta province of South Kivu closer to Burundi border, wey be wia dem station dia force.
Stearns say, ""Burundi dey worry say, if Rwandan troops… extend dia influence into South Kivu e go fit destabilize di goment for Bujumbura.""
Some dey fear di two wars wey bin occur for di region for late 1990s, fit repeat imsef. Dat war bin drag nine different kontris follow body and bin reportedly led to millions of deaths.
Uganda no dey directly involved, but imsef get troops for eastern DR Congo.
Dem dey help Congolese goment with anoda different security threat – hunting down militants wey from Uganda wey dey connected to Islamic State group.
But Uganda role dey confusing – e dey work wit di Congolese, while at di same time, e dey allegedly provide at least complicit support to M23.
UN experts dey report say dis dey allow dem to use Uganda territory as a back base and supply route.
Kampala strongly deny am. But e don respond to M23 offensive by putting im troops in ""forward defensive posture,"" to prevent oda armed groups from exploiting di crisis, e say.
Area pipo for di conflict area don report say dem dey see Uganda soldiers dey move enta di conflict zone.
Like Rwanda, Uganda don enta eastern DR Congo before claiming say e dey protect im borders.
But e dey also face accuse say e dey steal DR Congo natural resources, especially gold.
Analysts expect am to protect im economic interests even as e dey watch di Rwandans.
""E dey very clear say Uganda wan retain im own influence for eastern DR Congo and so dat im rival for Rwanda no g push am out,"" ICG Oga Moncrieff, tok.
South Africa contribute most of di sojas to one Southern African regional force wey dey fight alongside di Congolese army and don suffer heavy losses.
But dem also make headlines sake of one hurtful exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg.
South Africans bin blame di deaths of 14 of sojas on Rwandan Defense Forces, wey President Cyril Ramaphosa refer to as ""RDF militia.""
Im defence minister claim say im bin warn Kagame say dem go take any more shooting as declaration of war.
Dis tok vex Rwandan president, wey tok say di account of dia conversation na ""lie"" and e call South Africans ""aggressive"" force wey must leave DR Congo."

All ova di world, pipo dey struggle to couple up. For places like Iran, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and South Korea, di number of pipo in couples dey fall.
For China, marriages fall from 13 million for 2014 to just ova 6 million for 2024.
And survey data from Finland suggests say cohabiting couples dey more likely to break up dan dem fit start a family.
So why pipo for so many places dey struggle to form a lasting relationship?
Felipe, wey be 36 years old and dey live for Santa Catarina for Brazil say e neva get relationship despite say e dey try evritin wey e fit do to find partner.
For school, e dey write love letters to girls wey e get a crush on but di response no dey encouraging.
While e dey university e offer to help girls wit dia course work hoping say dem go spend more time wit am.
Den for im 30s e go for therapy to figure out how to connect wit women.
But tins neva work out so far.
""I be man wey no sabi wetin to do wit love life,"" e tok.
Felipe dey work as a copywriter and spend most of im 20s witout stable job. E believe say dis dey hurt im chances to impress women.
""But no be somtin wey just dey happun to me,"" e tok and add say many oda men dey feel lost and opting out of dating.
US data suggest say 18 to 24 years old, especially men, spend more time alone dan any oda group.
Dis na sharp opposite 20 years ago, wen dis age group socialise at least as much as pipo for dia 30s or 40s and much more dan dose wey be 50 and older.
Now, instead of spending time wit odas, young pipo dey spend am on social media, gaming and watching TV.
Brazil wia Felipe come from get di highest rates of social media use for di world.
Wit young pipo spending more time online, e go follow say dem dey date for dia too. But di use of dating apps dey reduce.
According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, di world six biggest dating apps get downloads fall by 18% for 2024 - di first drop for dia history.
Liesel Sharabi, director of di Relationships and Technology Lab at Arizona State University, say users dey frustrated, exhausted and overwhelmed by dating apps - by di quantity of matches but not di quality of connections.
One of di issues she find na di veri little innovation for how dem dey match pipo. Most apps get more male subscribers dan women.
""Men find say dem dey get ignored and dat fit dey uniquely frustrating.""
Dr Sharabi say women dey feel overwhelmed by di number of responses dem dey get.
She also believe say apps don introduce a lack of accountability for dating wey fit lead to rude or inconsiderate behaviour. ""Swipe afta swipe fit feel like say na products, no be pipo dem dey deal wit.""
Hassana from Abuja, in Nigeria, neva get into dating apps. ""E just feel like I dey auction mysef,"" she tok.
But she find offline dating difficult too becos di pool of men wey share her values dey small.
""I be feminist and na di cost of knowledge, e get certain tins I no fit just close my eyes to anymore,"" she tok.
She be 26 and lawyer by training but she dey run one successful laundry business as well as non-governmental organisation (NGO) wey dey support victims of domestic violence.
She believe say widespread access to di internet don give women for Nigeria di freedom to report domestic violence for ways dem neva do bifor wey mean say her generation dey more aware of di dangers of bad relationship.
Survey data from di US, China, South Korea and certain parts of Europe suggest a widening gap between young women - wey dey increasingly more progressive, especially wen e come to women rights - and young men wey dey less.
Dr Alice Evans, wey be sociologist, call am di great gender division and e dey write book on dis subject. She believe say di way we consume culture online fit be one of di reasons why dis dey happun.
""Women fit watch show wey dey cater to dia increasingly feminist interests wia men fit no dey progress at di exact same rate,"" she tok.
For Hassana, dat na true, too often she don see man wey she dey interested in following a social media account wit misogynistic views or agreeing wit misogynistic comments.
""E dey scary,"" she tok.
For Iran, 40-year-old Nazy get di same problem. She don dey single and dey look for love for di past 10 years.
But many women still get expectations of a partner wey dey rooted in traditional conservative roles.
Nazy and Hassana dey reluctant to partner wit someone wey no dey as financially secure as dem be.
Both women get post-graduate degrees and good careers. Di pool of available men dem fit consider as equals dey shrink. In most kontris, female graduates now outnumber men and girls outperform boys for school.
And wit less stigma around being alone, e dey get easier to opt out of dating, Dr Evans tok.
""Di rise of high quality personal entertainment mean say if dates dey boring, hey, you fit just stay in and watch Bridgerton or play video games,"" she tok.
She believe say na thoroughly good tin if pipo dey under less pressure to make a bad match.
But she dey worried about lack of connection among young pipo.
""If men and women no dey spend time togeda sharing intimate thoughts, sharing dia different perspectives on di world togeda, den e become harder to develop empathy,"" she tok.
Dr Sharabi wey study dating apps, agree say technology don remove some potential for real world connection.
""I get young pipo wey tell me say dem fit see someone cute for bar but dem no go approach dem, dem go go into dating app to see if dem dey dia instead,"" she tok.
""I tink in general we avoid human contact in a way wey we bin no dey do."""

Sabi pipo go later confam say di tin no be ordinary swelling, na cancer.
Im do 14 surgeries, some get complications, las las dem remove im voice box.

She bin find out dis condition afta im get promotion to di rank of senior midwifery officer for di hospital wia im dey work.
Dis cancer bin change im life for work and emotionally, as im also lose im 12-year-old marriage.

""I no sabi wetin self-love be. I no sabi wetin self-esteem be, until I bin get throat cancer,"" she tok.
Doctors no fit to find wetin cause Mary im cancer, but according to di WHO, ""for 90% of pipo, di body dey control di infection by itsef wey continuous human papillomavirus (HPV) infection wit high-risk HPV types, na di cause of cervical cancer wey e dey associated wit cancer of di vulva, vagina, mouth/throat, penis and anus.""
For 2019, HPV bin cause about 620,000 cancer cases in women wey 70,000 of di cases happun for men worldwide.
Di WHO 2022 global cancer observatory for Ghana show say throat cancer na di seventeenth cancer wey dey common out of thirty-two cancers, wey dem record 227 new cases dat year; also dem find five-year prevalence of 626.
For Africa, di observatory find say 10,665 new cases happun for 2022, wit a five-year prevalence of 28,077.
""People bin dey ignore di signs and symptoms – if we don find am early, we fit to do sometin about di situation,"" Dr Ama Boatemaa Prah, wey be Otolaryngologist wit Ghana Korlebu teaching hospital explain.
Early signs include if pesin voice block wey e no clear, pipo go dey struggle to breathe and dey swallow and if pesin get flu wey no dey go away – dem suppose take dis tins serious.
""Bifor we dey see throat cancer among old pipo but now, we dey see many young pipo – 40 years and below,"" Dr Prah tok.
Mary dey lucky say im dey get treatment wey she still dey alive, doctors bin tok say e dey too early to say she be cancer-free.
""Throat cancer take away my wonderful voice; wey e also take away my 12-year marriage,"" she said.
Her tori make her one of di women wey dia husband dey neglect dem wen dey get cancer, as one ogbonge research by di University of Michigan in 2014 find.
Di research show say 31% of marriages wey involve physical sickness dey end for divorce – as more men dey likely to leave dia sick wives.
Anoda study from di Fred Hutchinson cancer research centre for 2009, find say divorce rate wen di woman na di cancer patient dey at 20.8%, wia di rate wen di man na di cancer patient, na just 2.9%.
Sabi pipo for Ghana tok say dis wahala continue to dey happun even though no official data dey available.
Mary always dey tok to hersef say she make di right decision as im choose her life ova her marriage.
Her mama and papa and two pikins wey be 11 and eight years – dey support am even though di pikins no understand wetin dia mama dey go through at first.
""My mama tell us say im get cancer, na so we go visit am for hospital afta im surgery – I tink say she go die. But now, she still dey wit us and we dey happy,"" Emmanuella, Mary im eight-year-old pikin tok.
Dr Prah tok say Mary na ogbonge inspiration for oda pipo. ""Na determined woman, wey she always dey cheerful. We want make our oda patients look at Mary an kontinu to fight cancer,"" di doctor tok.
Di theme for dis year cancer day na 'united by unique' – wey begin one three-year-campaign to find different ways of cancer care wey dey focus on pipo and dia experience - and to find new ways to make a difference.

For di emergency summit for Paris, UK prime minister Keir Sarmer say any settlement wey go happun for di Ukraine war go need to be ""lasting peace deal, not just pause for Putin to come again.""
Starmer add say anoda important issue concerning di war, na di mata of ""wider peace"" wey be di ""collective security and defence of Europe. And here I tink we get generational challenge,"" im add.
After di meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tell tori pipo Reuters say, support for Ukraine must continue, as I add say, nobody fit impose any order on Ukraine.
Scholz say, im no believe say defence suppose be part of EU budget limit and say di union go fit defence imsef by imsef, if kontris for Europe spend more dan 2% of GDP on defence.
Scholz goes on to say that Germany will continue to invest in military spending, and that it must be more flexible with its budget rules.
Di German Chancellor come add say ""no split"" suppose dey between US and Europe on responsibility for Ukraine security.
Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister don first tok say, im ready to put UK peacekeeping troops for Ukraine if and wen di war end.

Europe bin dey expect more aggressive, America-first position from Trump administration, but e dey struggle to catch up as im bin no expect say tins go reach dis extent.
E dey struggle to understand Washington willingness to reach compromises wit Russia about Ukraine, regardless of how e go take affect Europe security.
US decision dey pain European kontris wey fit wan push back.
Dem believe say if dem no do so, dem go end up swallowing indigestible - possibly unsustainable - peace wey dem no go fit enforce.
But again, if dem push back too hard, though, dem risk breaking di transatlantic alliance into wider break.
And Europe influence dey limited, wit military capacity wey no too strong, sake of dem don depend on America security umbrella for years.
United States dey accounts for nearly 43% of all aid wey don go Ukraine since Russia invasion for 2022, according to Kiel Institute for World Economy.
Dis amount na about $120bn and e include all humanitarian, financial and military aid.
Europe as a whole don send less aid to Ukraine than US.
Funding through EU institutions account for just over 18%, wit di largest amounts of additional bilateral aid wey Germany dey provide (6.5%) and UK (5.5%) up to end of 2024.
Looking at just military support for Ukraine, US dominate again for funding, providing 49.4% of all spending since January 2022.
Germany provide nearly 10% and UK don give nearly 8% up to end of December 2024.
On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer say UK dey ""ready and dey willing to put troops for ground"".
Even for Germany, ahead of one heated election, di foreign policy tok-tok pesin of di CDU party, wey dey expected to win most of di seats say, Europe largest kontri go also commit troops within international framework.
Trump administration no dey 100% sure of wetin dem wan do about Ukraine. Some mixed messages bin fly ova di weekend.
Dis one allow Europe tiny window of opportunity to try persuade di American president say dem be partner im no fit throw one side. Dem dey hope to do am via dis Paris meeting.
Europe leaders insist Kyiv must dey directly involved in ceasefire toks too. For long, dem don maintain di opinion say "" decisions about Ukraine no fit dey, without Ukraine"".
No be all European countries go dey for Monday summit. Na only those wit military might go show: UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark – wey dey expected to represent di Baltic and Nordic nations, plus di EU Council president and di secretary general of di defence alliance, Nato.
Reports say oda countries go later hold follow-up meetings.
Even for di small Paris gathering, e go dey hard, if not impossible, to agree on concrete defence spending increases.
Poland dey plan to spend 4.47% of dia GDP on defence for 2025. UK dey struggle and dem neva reach, 2.5% of dia GDP.
But leaders fit pledge to coordinate beta, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine post-war reconstruction.
Di EU dey expected to boost dia defence effort too.
Large part of di Paris meeting go also focus on di question of sending troops to Ukraine afta a ceasefire.
Di idea dem wan discuss no be about peacekeeping troops but instead, ""reassurance force"", wey dem go station behind, rather dan on any eventual ceasefire line.
Di purpose of di European troop presence go be in three-fold. Firstly, na to send message to Ukrainians: say dem no dey alone. Another message na to di US, to show say Europe dey ""do dia bit"" for defence of dia own continent, and di last message na to Moscow, to warn say if dem break di terms of an eventual ceasefire, no be only Kyiv dem go dey deal wit."

Fear of raid, detention and deportation don make many African immigrant communities for America dey panic, and dis don force some of dem to go underground.
Immigrants tell BBC say na inside house dem dey stay now, dem dey skip work, reduce dia presence for public functions and no dey allow dia children go school sake of fear say officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) fit detain dem.
One of dem na Kaduli, one Congolese migrant wey enta US 11 years ago.
Dem born Kaduli for Bukavu for di eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, just outside Goma, wey M23 rebels recently capture.
E be general physician bifor e run go DRC to escape arrest afta e criticise di President wey bin dey dia bifor, Joseph Kabila, say e change di constitution to extend im term limit.
Kaduli tell BBC say now im don reduce im movements for di US, wey include visits to restaurants and shopping centres, becos of fear say dem fit forcefully deport am.
""Di current raid dey put us in permanent fear as dem dey confuse all immigrants as criminals, wey no be true,"" e tok.
""I dey fear becos war dey on for Congo. To send pesin back to Congo na to kill di pesin.""
Like Kaduli, Abdul, from Nigeria, also dey on di edge.
E go America wit im papa, wen e dey 10, dat na 30 years ago.
""I dey caution my waka and get faith in Allah say evri tin go dey alright,"" di Wisconsin resident tok.
Abdul don hear and watch how ICE officials carry out dia operations for oda cities. E say im dey fear make di same tin no happun to am.
""E dey crazy how dem dey treat pipo, like say we no be pesin too. All of us be humans, and all of us dey bleed di same way,"" e tok.
All di migrants we interview for dis tori say make only identify dem by only dia first names, dem dey fear retribution or attention from authorities.
Since e return to di White House for January, di Trump administration don take di mass deportation wit all seriousness, as dem dey raid undocumented migrants for major cities.
E redirect military resources to empower immigration officers to make more arrests, wey include for schools, churches and hospitals. Dis don draw criticism from civil and immigrant right groups.
Dem don detain thousands of pipo, both criminals and those wey no get criminal histories.
Last week, ICE officers bin intensify dia arrests, as dem dey detain around one thousand pipo evri day.
By comparison, Joe Biden administration bin carry out an average of 311 immigration deportations of mostly criminals daily, according to ICE.
Trump government also dey reason to enforce di Alien Enemies Act, wey go allow authorities to quickly deport migrants dem feel say dey part of an ""invasion or predatory incursion"" — one law dem dey only invoke in wartime.
Pious Ali, one Portland city councillor for di state of Maine, tok say while deportations no dey new, dem dey abuse di process by raiding places like schools, churches and synagogues and ""dem dey openly parade pipo"" like criminals.
E say for migrants wey dey worried, e dey important to ""write plan down for your family and put some food and money on di side"".
""If di agent knock for your door, dem no fit enta without a warrant from di court,"" e tok.
Many African migrants dey live in fear sake of di uncertainty around di renewal of dia kontri tenure under di Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme.
Dis dey allow migrants from qualified kontris — usually kontris wey dey witness armed conflict, natural disasters or oda ""extraordinary and temporary"" conditions — safety to stay for di US and apply for work permits.
Sylvie Bello, chief executive of di Cameroon American Council (CAC), one Washington-based organization wey dey advocate for Central African migrants, tok say di current uncertainty na sake of di policies of di previous Biden administration.
She say her community bin hope say Oga Biden go extend di TPS to Angola and DR Congo wen e visit there for November, im only travel go di continent.
""But e fail dem,"" she tok.
""Black Africans wey dem no extend dia TPS fit face deportation now under Trump,"" she tok.
About one million immigrants from 17 kontris – 5 for Africa – dey protected by di TPS programme.
TPS for immigrants from Cameroon, Ethiopia and South Sudan go end dis year. TPS for migrants from Somalia and Sudan go end for 2026.
""All my communities dey suffer from deportation anxiety,"" Sylvie Bello tok.
In recent years, Africans don increasingly turn to migration routes to enta America through South America and Mexico.
Nneka Achapu, one Texas-based US-Africa policy strategist, tok say dis na becos pipo see di Mediterranean crossing go Europe as too dangerous.
According to di ICE annual report for 2024, dem deport around 1,818 African individuals from di US, wit Senegal, Mauritania, and Nigeria top di list.
Out of di 1.4 million noncitizens di ICE schedule to deport from di kontri as of November 2024, three percent na Africans.
Somalia top di list wit 4,090 individuals, followed by Mauritania wit 3,822, Nigeria wit 3,690 and Ghana wit 3,228.
""We gatz go through dis for four years or however long dis goes on,"" Abdul tok.
But US-Africa policy strategist, Nneka Achapu, tok say di situation fit be chance for di US African community to show dia resilience.
""As pipo face renewed attacks on immigrants, we dey reminded say di strength of African communities lie in working togeda, protecting di most vulnerable, and sharing critical resources,"" she tok.
Achapu believe say dis uncertain time na opportunity for African governments to reorganize themselves, confront di root causes of migration, and create economic opportunities for dia pipo.
""If America continue to push immigrants away, China, Russia, plus oda global powers fit seize di opportunity to expand dia influence in Africa, offering alternative migration pathways, economic partnerships, and trade deals wey fit reshape di US-Africa relations in ways we neva fully grasp,"" she tok."

Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) don tok say di exit of three kontris as member states don take effect on Wednesday 29 January 2025.
One year ago Burkina Faso, di Republic of Mali, and Republic of Niger announce dia exit from di bloc.
Ecowas for dia announcement tok say dem go keep di doors open sake of spirit of regional solidarity.
But di move by di Sahel State kontries to launch dia own common passport mean say to go back no too sure.
Ecowas further tok say di arrangements go dey in place until leaders of di join-bodi go fully determine how future engagements wit di three kontries go be.
Di Commission say structure don dey ground to arrange tok-tok about di wey tins go be now wit kontries one by one.
Dem say all dis arrangement dey key so confusion and disturb no go dey for lives and businesses of pipo during di transition period.
Di three kontris bin go ahead to form one Sahel state. Military-led Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, wey form di three Sahel neighbours officially comot di West Africa regional bloc on Wednesday.
Dia plan na to issue new travel passport wey go tally wit dia withdrawal from Ecowas.
Di junta leaders wey now dey under di platform of di Alliance of Sahel State (AES) bin tok say di move na part of efforts to strengthen cooperation between Member States.
According to tori pipo, di new passport dey expected to become functional from Wednesday 29 January and go replace di Ecowas passport wey citizens of di three kontries.
Di Sahel authorities dey encourage pipo to register for di new passport, although dem add say di pipo Ecowas passports go remain valid until di day e expire.
On Tuesday 28 January, hundreds of pro-juntas' demonstrators for Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger for one rally bin enta streets to show support to di decision to comot di regional bloc.
For Niger, members of di military bin lead plenti pipo wey reach thousands regime to gather around one square for di capital Niamey.
Dem kontinu dia waka towards di national assembly wit chants of unfriendly slogans to French President Emmanuel Macron and oda leaders for di region.
Niger don put strain for dia relationship wit neighbouring kontries like Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Benin.
Sometin similar also happun for Burkina Faso, wia di Prime Minister Rimtalba Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo, members of di govment and thousands odas bin gather for Ouagadougou Nation square to rally in support of di development.
No rally bin hold for Mali but development still dey expected acress di regions.
Dis kontries exit na big deal for Ecowas, as di bloc go need deep reassessment of im future wey appear to dey uncertain.
Ecowas say di Sahel states get six month grace period wey go run till July, to reconsider dia positions, in case dem decide to dey readmitted.
Make we take you back to how di exit of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from Ecowas begin.
E bin start wen di Ecowas Authority of Heads of State and Government - wey Nigeria President Bola Tinubu be di Chairman - threaten to use military force to comot di military junta wey take ova power from Niger Republic for 2023.
Na afta dat di three kontris exit and dem officially announce di new alliance.
Dem redesign dia passport and comot di Ecowas logo, recently, although dem announce visa-free travel and residency rights to citizens of Ecowas kontris but we neva sabi how e go be now, wen di exit don take effect.
Dem bin tok say di decision na in di spirit of friendship, and to strengthen centuries-old ties among African pipo.
Political sabi pipo dey worry say travel restrictions go further weaken regional integration, worsen di ease of doing business, and slow economic development if e dey effective.
Now, di three kontris go lose di duty-free trade benefits among member states wey Ecowas members dey enjoy.
Travel fit become difficult for oda West Africans wey go visit di Sahel kontries.
Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger dey landlocked wit no access to di sea, and dis go make dem dependent on dia coastal neighbours including Togo, Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria for international trade.
According to Ecowas Trade Information Systems (ECOTIS), for 2022, Mali exports total $3.91 billion, wit imports of $6.45 billion, while Burkina Faso export na $4.55 billion, and import na $5.63 billion. Niger record $446.14 million in exports and $3.79 billion in imports.
For all dis trades to kontinu, di Sahel kontries go require access to ports of oda West African kontries, wey go attract higher costs – in tariffs and duties – if dem stop to be Ecowas members.
Na for December 2000 dem introduce di Ecowas passport, and e provide di den fifteen member kontries wit visa-free movements within di region and function as international travel document.
Ecowas citizens get di right to live within member kontri for up to three months, but dis fit change for those wey go visit kontries wey no longer be part of di regional bloc.
Also, wit intermarriages bin dey common especially around border areas.
Example na between Nigeria and Niger, Ghana and Burkina Faso, and odas.
Some family members wey wan visit relatives for Sahel kontries go now need visas to fit enta and e go be so for di Sahel states pipo too.
Dis na serious mata as e go further make weak regional integration.
Also business, economic development, and di continental free trade agreement go dey affected."

Dis week na humiliating week for nearly 300 Romanian mercenaries wey dem recruit to fight on di side of di army of di Democratic Republic of Congo.
Dia surrender come afta one rebel attack on di eastern city of Goma don also shatter di dreams of those wey sign up for di job to earn big money.
Di BBC don see contracts wey show say dem dey pay these hired sojas around $5,000 (£4,000) per month, while regular military recruits dey receive around $100, or sometimes dem no go even pay dem.
DR Congo bin contract di Romanians to help dia army fight di Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, wey say dem dey fight to protect di rights of DR Congo minority ethnic Tutsis.
Wen di attack on Goma bin start on Sunday night, di Romanians dey forced to go hide for one UN peacekeeping base.
""Troops and and state-of-di-art military equipment from Rwanda bin support di M23 rebels and dem manage to reach our positions around di city of Goma,"" Constantin Timofti, wey dem describe as co-ordinator for di group, tell Romanian TVR channel on Monday.
""Di national army stop to dey fight and we dey forced to withdraw.""
Romania foreign ministry tok-tok pesin Andrei Țărnea tell BBC say ""complex"" negotiations follow, wey see as di M23 hand ova di Romanian fighters – wey e describe as private employees of di DR Congo goment on army training mission - to Rwanda.
Goma siddon right on di border wit Rwanda – and tori pipo feem di mercenaries as dem cross over and surrender to body searches and oda checks.
Bifor dem cross over, phone footage show as M23 commander Willy Ngoma dey tok down on one of di Romanians in French, e tell am to sit on di ground, cross im legs and put im hands ova im head.
E ask am about im military training – I train wit di French Foreign Legion, di Romanian reply.
""Dem recruit you wit salary of $8,000 per month, you eat well,"" Ngoma shout, as e point out di difference between dia money and dat of Congolese army recruit salary.
""We dey fight for our future. No come for adventure here,"" e warn.
E no dey clear where Ngoma dey get di $8,000 figure, but di contract wey one former Romanian mercenary show di BBC for October show ""strictly confidential remuneration"" for senior personnel wey start at $5,000 per month during active duty and $3,000 during periods of leave.
Di agreement outline ""indefinite period"" of service, and contractors dey scheduled to take one-month break afta every three months of deployment.
I meet di ex-mercenary for Romania capital, Bucharest, wen I go investigate Asociatia RALF, wey one group of UN experts say na Romanian enterprise wit ""ex-Romanians from diFrench Foreign Legion"".
Na Horațiu Potra, one Romanian wey describe himself as military instructor.
For June while in Goma, I bin notice those kain mercenaries for checkpoints and di ones dem deploy around di city, dem dey work closely wit di army.
Ova di last three years, many pipo don report say dem dey see di Congolese troops dey drive wit army vehicles.
""Wen dem land, everybody dey call dem Russian,"" Fiston Mahamba, co-founder of disinformation group Check Congo, told the BBC.
""I bin think say dem dey connected to Russian mercenary group, Wagner say dia presence dey for several African countries.""
In fact, Asociatia RALF fit also work across Africa – dia contract show say dem get various ""operational locations"", wey include ""Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea"".
UN experts say dem bring these two private military companies d to bolster its forces in 2022, not long after the M23 had regrouped and begun capturing territory in North Kivu.
Di province don dey unstable for decades and plenty militias dey operate for there, dey make money from dia minerals like gold and coltan – dem dey use make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.
Di first firm DR Congo sign up na Agemira RDC, wey Olivier Bazin, one French-Congolese national dey head. Di experts say di company employ Bulgarian, Belarusian, Georgian, Algerian, French and Congolese nationals.
Dia work na to renovate and increase DR Congo military air assets, renovate airports and ensure di physical security of aircraft plus oda strategic locations.
Di second contract wey dem sign na between Congo Protection, one Congolese company wey Thierry Kongolo dey represent, and Asociatia RALF.
According to UN experts, di contract show say Asociatia RALF get expertise and extensive experience for di provision of security management services.
Dem go provide training and instruction to di Congolese troops on di ground through contingent of 300 instructors, many of dem Romanians.
Wen I follow Oga Potra tok for July about di extent of im group involvement on di ground and weda dem follow for di fight, e say: ""We gatz protect ourselves. If M23 attack us, dem no go say: 'Oh, una just be instructors - go house'.""
Oga Potra bin dey very active during di DR Congo mission until a few months ago wen e go back Romania - and dey for wrapped for controversy for di middle of di cancelled presidential election there.
Dem dramatically arrest am for December, and e deny providing security for di pro-Russian, far-right candidate Călin Georgescu. And since October, e don refuse to return di BBC calls.
Di ex-mercenary, wey dey im his late forties and follow BBC tok on condition of anonymity, tok say im bin resign becos im dey unhappy on how Asociatia RALF deu operate.
E say di Romanians do plenty things on ground for North Kivu province: ""Only very few of us be trainers.
""We dey work long shifts of up to 12 hours, dey guard key positions outside Goma.""
E maintain say di money no worth di risks di military contractors gatz take.
""Missions dey disorganised, working conditions poor. Make Romanians stop dey go there becos e dey dangerous.""
E also claim say dem no do proper background checks, and some of di Romanian recruits no get military training – e use di example of one of im former colleagues wey be firefighter.
DR Congo government neva reply to BBC request for comment on weda dem carry out background checks, or about di pay disparity between di private contractors and Congolese troops.
Di family of Vasile Badea, one of two Romanians wey die last February wen M23 fighters ambush one army convoy wey dey on dia way to Sake, one frontline town near Goma, tell BBC say na police officer im be.
Di 46-year-old bin take sabbatical from di force and take up di role for DR Congo sake of di beta salary offer.
Di policeman bin dey struggle to pay for one apartment e just get and need money to pay for am.
Many more Romanians bin dey lured sake of di prospect of a well-paid job.
I meet one man for Bucharest for October, who go back im kontri dey find more recruits to go to Goma. E get military background and don do Nato tours for Afghanistan wit di Romanian army.
""We dey very busy trying to find 800 pipo wey need to dey mentally prepared for di job and sabi how to fight,"" di mercenary recruiter tell BBC.
E say im no work for Asociatia RALF, and no gree tok which outfit e dey work wit.
""Dem dey place di recruits for positions wey correspond to di level of dia training, ande dem dey earn between $400-$550 per day,"" e explain.
Wen dem ask am about di recruitment process, e say e dey confidential.
""Dem no dey publish dis kain work anywhere,"" e tok, and add say na on networks like WhatsApp you go see am.
E show me one WhatsApp group where more dan 300 Romanians don sign up, many of dem be ex-military personnel.
For June last year, Rwanda government tok-tok pesin Yolande Makolo bin kick against di presence of mercenaries for eastern DR Congo, e say na violation of di Geneva Conventions, wey prohibit di use of hired combatants.
In response, Congolese government tok-tok pesin Patrick Muyaya dismiss wetin e call Rwanda perennial complaint.
""We get some instructors wey dey come train our military forces becos we know say we get urgent situation,"" e tell BBC.
But one Congolese soja wey I meet for June express dia disappointment ova di army strategy.
""Di pay dey unfair. Wen e come to fighting, na us dem dey send go di front lines first,"" e tell BBC on condition of anonymity.
""Dem [di mercenaries] dey only come as back-up.""
E confam say im pay na around $100 a month, but e no dey come on time or make dem no pay at all.
I follow am tok last week ago, and e confam say im stll dey stationed for Kibati, near Goma, where di army get base.
""Things dey very bad,"" e tok for one voice note to me.
I no fit reach out to am since then - and M23 don take ova di base since and kill many sojas, including dia commander.
Observers say di quick fall of Goma point to DR Congo fractured defence strategy, where overlapping forces plus blurred lines of command later fall into di hands of M23.
Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group project director for di Great Lakes, say mercenaries, di Congolese army work wit troops from di Southern African Development Community (Sadc), one local militia wey dey known as Wazalendo, plus sojas from Burundi also lead to di fall.
""E create situation wia e dey impossible to plan military attack wen chain of command and responsibility dey messed up,"" e tell BBC.
""I think say e dey important to work towards far greater coherence in di armed effort for North Kivu, probably reduce di number of armed groups or armed actors on di ground.""
For di ex-mercenary, di fate of im former Romanian colleagues no come as surprise.
""Poor command lead to failure,"" e tell BBC."

Di Democratic Republic of Congo dey inside serious trouble as fighters from di M23 rebel group don dey enta through di kontri east and dey battle di national army and dem dey capture key places as dem dey go.
In just two weeks, tori be say thousands of pipo don dey killed and di fighting don turn war of words between DR Congo and dia neighbour, Rwanda.
So how DR Congo, wey be di biggest kontri for sub-Saharan Africa, carry demselves reach dis level?
You fit understand di start of dis kasala if you torchlight di tori of one man, M23 leader Sultani Makenga wey don dey accused of plenti war crimes allegations.
To look into Makenga life na to look into decades of war, some foreign intervention and di lure of DR Congo rich mineral resources.
Im life start on Christmas day of 1973 wen dem born for di lush Congolese town for Masisi.
E bin dey raised by Tutsi parents, and at di age of 17 e comot school to join one Tutsi rebel group for Rwanda.
Di group wey dem call di Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) bin dey ask for more Tutsi representation for Rwanda goment wey dat time bin dey full of politicians from di Hutu majority.
Dem bin also want di hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees wey ethnic kasala bin pursue comot di kontri make dem come back house.
For four years, Makenga and di RPF bin fight di Hutu filled army for Rwanda. Di fight-fight join wit di 1994 genocide wen Hutu extremists bin kill 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Wen e bin look dis time for one rare interview for 2013, Makenga say: ""My life na war, my education na war and my language na war... but I respect peace.""
Di RPF seize more and more lands small-small bifor dem match enta di Rwanda capital of Kigali so dem go overthrow di extremist Hutu goment, and many of dem run enta wetin today be DR Congo.
Wit RPF for power, Makenga come join di official Rwandan army and rise to di rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander.
One of Makenga fellow RPF fighters tell di RIft Valley Institute wey be non-profit research organisation say, ""e bin dey very good wit setting up ambushes"".
Im progress for di Rwandan army sha take style hang. Di fact say e bin get only basic education and fit speak broken French and English bin dey stand as ""challenge to im military career"", according to di Rift Valley Institute.
Dem also tok say, till today, Makenga dey very reserved and dey find am hard to tok for public.
For 1997, e bin dey part of di Rwandan-backed forces wey las-las take ova power for DR Congo and comot long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko. To replace am, dem put veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
But Makenga bin start to dey clash wit im ogas dem. Rwandan authorities bin arrest am afta im refuse orders to go back to Rwanda, according to one UN Security Council report.
So, dem imprison am for many years for di island of Iwawa.
Meanwhile, di relationship between Kabila and Rwanda new leaders start to scata.
Rwanda bin wan crush di Hutu militiamen wey bin dey responsible for di genocide but dem run across di border for 1994. Rwanda bin fear say dem go come back and scata di kontri stability wey dem don struggle to win.
But Kabila bin fail to stop di militants from organising and e also comot di Rwandan troops by force.
Bicos of dat, Rwanda invade DR Congo for 1998. Wen Makenga bin dey released from prison, dem appoint am as commander for di front line wit one Rwanda backed rebel group.
Ova di years, e gain di reputation from being very strategic and skilled wit commanding large group of sojas to battle.
Afta Rwanda troops cross enta DR Congo, discrimination against di Tutsi community start to increase again. Kabila bin allege say di Tutsis support di invasion while oda officials bin ginger di public to attack members of di ethnic group.
Makenga wey still dey DR Congo bin accuse di Congolese leader say im betray Tutsi fighters say: ""Kabila na politician, and I no be politician. I be soja and di language wey I sabi na gun.""
Plenti neighbour kontris bin dey dragged to di kasala as one ogbonge UN military force bin dey deployed to try keep order.
More dan five million pipo, na im dey believed say bin die for di war and afta. Most of dem bin die from starvation or disease.
Di fight-fight bin officially end for 2003 but Makenga continue to dey work for armed groups to di Congolese goment.
In di spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga bin las-las join di Congolese goment armed forces for wetin dem call ""mixage"".
But di political stands for DR Congo dey always shift, and na so Makenga defect from di army to join di M23 rebellion wey bin dey on di rise.
Di M23 bin don dey very active for DR Congo east say dem dey fight for Tutsi rights and goment no gree honour peace deal wey dem sign for 2009.
Makenga bin dey elevated to di rank of M23 general and den soon reach di top position.
For November 2012, e lead di rebels for ogbonge fight-fight, from wia dem capture di city of Goma, wey be major eastern city wey get ova one million pipo.
DR Congo and di UN bin accuse di Rwanda Tutsi full goment say dem back di M23. Kigali don deny dis allegation many times. But recently di official statement don shift, as goment tok-tok pipo say to fight near di border na security threat.
By 2012, Makenga and odas for M23 dey face serious war crimes accuse. Di US don impose sanctions on am say e dey responsible for ""di recruitment of child sojas and campaigns of violence against civilians"". Makenga say di accuse say M23 dey use pikin as sojas dey ""baseless"".
Di US also say e don commit and dey responsible for tins like killing and maiming, sexual kasala and kidnapping.
Apart from asset freezes, Makenga bin also dey face bitter division for inside di M23. One side back am as dia leader while di oda bin support im rival, Gen Bosco Ntaganda.
Di Enough Project wey be non-profit group wey dey work for DR Congo say di two sides bin enta full war for 2013 wey kill three sojas and eight civilians.
Makenga side bin wine and Ntaganda run enta Rwanda wia e surrender to di US embassy.
Gen Ntaganda wey dem bin nickname ""Terminator"" bicos of im brutality, bin dey sentenced to 30 years in prison for war crimes by di International Criminal Court (ICC).
But months afta di Makenga win, anoda bigger threat bin come. Di UNbin deploy one 3,000 force wit di mission to support di Congolese military to fit take back Goma and ginger di M23 to withdraw.
Di rebel group bin dey expelled from di kontri and Makenga bin run enta Uganda, anoda kontr wey dem accuse say dey support M23, wey dem too don deny.
Uganda don receive extradition request from DR Congo for Makenga but dem no act on am.
Eight years later, plenti armed groups still dey scata di mineral-rich east of DR Congo but at least authorities dey free from dia most notorious militants.
Until 2021.
Makenga and im rebels carry weapons again anf take ova territory for di North Kivu province.
Several ceasefires between di M23 and di Congolese authorities don fail. Even sef last year one udge sentence Makenga to death in im absence.
For M23 latest advance, wey tori be say na thousands of Rwandan troops dey support di rebels, pipo neva too see Makenga in public.
Instead na im tok-tok pesin and Corneille Nangaa wey be oga of alliance of rebel groups wey include M23 na im dey run public speeches and statements.
But Makenga still be key player, and e be like say na behind di scene strategy e dey focus on.
E don tok say im fighting na for im three pikin, ""so dat one day dem go get bata future for dis kontri"".
E tok say, ""make una no look me as pesin wey no want peace o. I get heart and family and pipo wey I care about"".
But millions of ordinary pipo dey pay di price for dis kasala and if Congolese forces catch am, Makenga dey look death sentence.
Yet e no dey shake am.
E say, ""I dey willing to sacrifice evritin""."

President of Ghana John Mahama don give im appointees up to 31 March to declare dia assets or im go punish dem.
Dis na afta im present im asset declaration form to di kontri auditor general on 18 February 2025.
Di kontri law for asset declaration under di public office holders act, dey provide say make public officers provide detailed account of dia assets, properties and oda liabilities bifor dem go enta public office.
John Mahama tok say ""in di past, I go present dis form to di auditor general privately, but decide say dis time I go present am for public to show transparency for dis process.""
""I don maintain say to punish corruption, we gatz prevent di act from happening in di first place, no be only to punish corruption afta e don happun.""
Na so im add say im give im appointees up to 31 March to declare dia own asset or dem go face punishment wia fit include sacking from office.
Public officials gatz publish dia assets afta dem declare am to di auditor
Sabi pipo don chook mouth for di mata about asset declaration.
Currently, di law don tok say pesin gat to complete and submit written declaration of all dia property or assets wia dem get directly or indirectly on top on form, to di auditor general.
Di law no dey allow say make even di auditor open di envelope wia get di information unless time don reach wia sakala don happun about a particular pesin wia dem go open am.
Na so sabi pipo tok say dat na wrong tin.
Sake of since di auditor no fit to open di documents, pipo fit submit incomplete documents or odas go stuff di envelope and present to di AG office.
Di Ghana integrity initiative bin dey on dis crusade say make politicians and oda public officers go beyond declaration to publish dia assets so say everibodi go know di properties dem get bifor dem go enta office and when dem comot office, wetin dem get.
""We don dey call for asset declaration regime wey ensure say di public officers go publish dia assets wey di auditor general go verify dem bifor dem go enta public office,"" madam Mary Adda wey be executive director for di anti-corruption organisation don tok.
Dis go help to deal wit corruption wia e go address di issue of public officers wia don dey use dia office to make moni to buy properties wia dem sometimes dey register dis assets in di name of dia children.
In 2024, current Senegal president Diomaye Faye bifor im contest dia election, declare all im assets.

Im also challenge all di oda contenders say make dem declare and publish dia assets ahead of dat election in March, but none of di candidates do am.
Many pipo don tok say Diomaye Faye don set good example for African presidents and politicians.
One of im campaign promises na to fight corruption, na so im start am so.
For Liberia, di President Joseph Boakai suspend more dan 450 goment officials wey fail to declare dia assets to di kontris anti-corruption agency.
Di president tok say dis goment officials no go receive pay for one month or ""until dem submit di declarations.""
Di law for Liberia dey require say all public officers go declare dia wealth bifor dem go take up dia post and when dem leave goment.
Bifor im inauguration as president in 2024, President Boakai declare im own assets wey im publish am.
Inside im asset declaration document, di president tok say im get cars, cows and pigs worth $212,400.
Im tok say im net worth minus liabilities na $970,419, wey im commercial and residential properties in total dey cost $766,391.
Im also get $61,295 cash for two banks for di kontri.
In 2015, then Nigeria president Muhammadu Buhari declare im assets as im preach transparency.
Im declare sat im get $150,000 for im personal account wey im get 5 houses and two mud houses.
Buhari also tok at di time for im declaration say im get orchard and ranch wit 270 cattle, 25 sheep, 5 horses and oda birds.

Di president also say im buy two cars wit im savings.
Pipo don tok say African presidents gat to be transparent wit dia pipo and declare dia assets bifor after afta dem leave public office.
Dis na one of di ways to get di trust of di pipo.
Ova di years, Ghana don dey fall for di corruption perception index by transparency international.

Sulaiman Bala Idris, wey be Zamfara State Govnor tok-tok pesin, tell BBC say dem launch dis program to give chance to bandits wey don tire and wan find way to surrender.
E tok say, ""For any war, once di enemy don dey lose ground and di fight don near end, dem go give chance to di ones wey wan surrender.
""Right now, e be like say we don weaken di bandits for Zamfara well well. Plenty don scatter, some don run leave dia family and property. Pipo like dis fit get chance to come surrender.""
Sulaiman Bala Idris tok say some pipo go tink say na peace agreement dem dey do wit di bandits, but e no be so. Instead, na di bandits dey find way to surrender sake of dem no fit continue di fight again.
E tok say, ""Pipo wey go fit stay for di program na di bandits wey get wife and pikin becos even for war, dem no dey kill women and children. Na dem we wan help, no be di big oga for bandit work.""
""No be say we go carry pesin like Turji (one notorious bandit leader) kon go settle am for di program. Make pipo understand dis one. Some big bandit leaders dey wey even if dem surrender, e no mean say dem go accept dem inside di program.""
Dis program na federal goment plan wey dem do wit Zamfara State goment and oda northwest states.
Di program na for bandits wey don tire for di wahala, wey wan find beta life. Dem go drop dia guns, kon get place wey dem and dia family fit stay witout condition.

Di authorities for Nigeria dey tok say dem dey try dia best to stop di crisis, especially di bandit attacks wey dey happun steady for northwest states like Zamfara, Katsina, Sokoto, and Kaduna.
Zamfara na one of di states wey bandit wahala strong well well. Dem dey enter villages, dey kill pipo, kidnap for ransom, and even dey carry farm produce wey farmers plant.
BBC reach out to di military for comment but dem neva respond to dis tori.
Experts dey see dis move as beta step wey fit help bring peace for di region, especially if dem do di program well.
Security expert Dr. Auwal Abdullahi Aliyu for Nigeria tell BBC News Pidgin say dis plan get two sides, advantage and disadvantage.
""First, e good if di pipo wey dem give amnesty wey dey do kidnapping, killing, and raping drop dia weapons and help securities catch di bandits wey dey disturb innocent pipo for di region.
""Dis go help reduce di number of terrorists wey dey inside society,"" e tok.
But Dr. Aliyu still tok say if goment no take beta steps, e get serious wahala wey fit happun.
""Di problem be say, if pesin wey dem kidnap im family see say di bandits wey do di bad tin don get amnesty and dem don reintegrate dem inside society, e fit make am wan do revenge.""
""Anybodi wey don pay ransom and still lose im family member go feel say goment no do anytin to help am. If e kon see say di same criminals wey cause am pain don come back dey live normal life, e fit wan take action by imsef.""
E add say goment suppose reason how dem go take compensate pipo wey suffer loss, so wahala no go burst.
""Plenty pipo dey sell dia property just to find money take free dia relatives from kidnappers.
""Goment need to pay dem back wetin dem lose or find way to support dem, so wahala no go dey wen dis kain pipo wey dem forgive start to live inside society again,"" Dr. Aliyu tok."

Afta di meeting for Riyadh, Trump say e dey ""much more confident"".
""Dem dey very good,"" e tok. ""Russia wan do sometin. Dem wan stop di savage barbarianism.""
""I tink say I get di power to end dis war,"" e bin add.

Stress say Moscow no go gree to peacekeeping forces from Nato kontries for Ukraine under any peace deal, Lavrov tok: ""Any appearance by armed forces under some oda flag no dey change anytin. Of course e dey completely unacceptable.""
E say di US and Russia go appoint ambassadors to each oda kontris as soon as possible and create conditions to ""restore co-operation in full"".
""Na very useful conversation. We bin listen to each oda, and we hear each oda,"" e tok.
E repeat say Russia previous position say any expansion of di Nato defence alliance - and Ukraine to join am - go be ""direct threat"" to Russia.

""All sides need to concede somtin. We no go predetermine wetin dem be.""
""Today na di first step of one long and difficult journey, but important one"", e add.
Rubio say di European Union go ""need to be at di table at some point sake of say dem get sanctions wey don dey imposed"".
On absence of Ukraine for di meeting, e insist say ""no-one dey sidelined"".
Di tok-tok for Paris, wey dem rush arrange for response to di obvious dislike between Russia and di US under Trump, no gree any unified position.
Germany Chancellor Olaf Scholz say to dey discuss to send troops to Ukraine for present dey ""completely premature"".
Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk also tok say e no get mind to send troops while Italy Giorgia Meloni - di only European leader to attend Trump inauguration - express doubts.

""We want everytin to dey fair and so dat nobody go decide anytin behind our back,"" Zelensky tok.
""You no fit make decisions without Ukraine on how to end di war for Ukraine.""
E go dey alarmed by all di smiles on both American and Russian faces for Riyadh, but e go know say e fit do little to change whatever dey agree on over im head.
Di Ukrainian president go also know say im kontri chances to resist - let alone defeat - Russian troops without American help dey very slim.
Following di overthrow of Ukraine pro-Russian president for 2014, Moscow bin annex di Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and back pro-Russian separatists for bloody fight for eastern Ukraine.
Di conflict burst into all-out war wen Russia invade Ukraine on 24 February 2022.

Di allegations come as a civil trial dey expected to begin on Thursday for di High Court in London, wia lawyers wey dey represent two Ogoni communities of around 50,000 inhabitants go say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution wey occur between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from dia infrastructure.
Di communities say di spills don leave dem without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and create serious risks to public health.
Shell, wey don dey push to sell dia assets for di West African kontri to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, don indicate say dem go defend di claims.
Dem deny any wrongdoing and say spills for di region dey caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining wey di company say dem no dey liable.
Di BBC don visit di affected areas for di Niger Delta, wia Shell, di largest private oil and gas company for di kontri, discover di existence of crude oil 68 years ago.
Di UN say at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil don dey spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents for di Niger Delta region.
Di spills don leave many families worried for dia health and livelihoods.
Grace Audi, 37, dey live wit her partner and two-year-old for Ogale, wia dem don get at least 40 oil spills from Shell infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, di UK-law firm wey dey represent di communities for dis case.
Her family and neighbours only get access to a contaminated borehole, forcing dem to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, £2.40) - for area wia di average daily wage dey less dan $8.
Dis na familiar story to many in Ogoni.
Paulina Agbekpekpe tell di BBC say lush greenery wey bin once surround di mangroves of her community for Bodo - wey no be one of dos wey dey go court on Thursday. She say di rivers and ponds wey dem dey use dey full wit different kain animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.
""Di place bin dey greener, not only mangroves, but all by di shoreline - e bin get pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during di spills, di destruction don pollute evriwia,"" di 50-year-old mother of six tok.
Her family for generations don survive on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.
""Most of di children - from di drinking water - don get diseases. Many don die. Me I don lose eight kids. My husband dey sick.
""Becos dem don take away our livelihoods, pipo for Bodo dey hungry and dem dey suffer.""
In 2011, di UN Environment Programme (UNEP) bin publish a major study into di impact of pollution on di oil-rich area.
Dem find out say members of one community for Ogoniland dey drink water wey dey polluted wit a known carcinogen at levels more dan 900 times above di World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. Di same chemical, benzene, dey detected in all dia air samples.
Dem also find out say sites wey Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claim say dem don remediate, still dey polluted and di techniques dem use bin no reach regulatory requirements.
Di report conclude say a comprehensive clean-up of di area go take 25-30 years - and e lead to di formation of di Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).
Dis bin initially dey established by di Nigerian goment in 2012, but no clean-up start - until e come dey relaunched by a new goment in December 2016.
Hyprep dey part-funded by oil companies including di state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, wey give $350m.
However, di BBC don see internal documents wey suggest say Nigerian goment bin warn representatives of Shell plenty times of di agency alleged fraudulent practices.
One pesin wey dey aware of di project tok to di BBC about dia concerns - and ask to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.
""Na common knowledge say really wetin we dey do na scam. Most of am na to fool di Ogoni pipo,"" di whistleblower tok.
""Na wayo wey dem play so dat more money go enta into di pot and end up in di pockets of politicians and oda pipo in power.""
Di allegations about failings for Hyprep include:
In di minutes of one meeting for 2023, wey representatives from Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di UNEP and Hyprep attend, dem point out say ""incompetent"" contractors ""dey engaged again"" and say make dem “ no dey allowed to further degrade di environment"".
In a separate leaked report wey di BBC see from di same year, dem point out say laboratory results bin dey ""regularly reported wit deviations"".
In 2022, di UN write to Nigeria environment ministry, wit warning say if nothing change, di ""extremely poor standards"" of di clean-up go kontinu.
Di BBC has ask HYPREP and di Nigerian goment to comment on di allegations but neva get any response.
But our investigation don reveal evidence say Shell dey aware of di problems.
In a meeting wit di British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes wey we obtain under di Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledge di ""institutional challenges"" of di clean-up agency and di chance of di refusal of ""future funding"" toward am.
Shell tell di BBC: ""Hyprep na agency wey dey established and overseen by di federal goment of Nigeria, wit dia governing council largely include senior ministers and goment officials, along wit five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single Shell representative.""
Dis no be di only remediation project for Ogoniland wey allegedly no dey work.
In 2015, Shell agree to a £55m settlement for a clean-up afta two catastrophic spills in 2008 from dia infrastructure in di Bodo area.
Di company say di clean-up, wey di Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) do, wey suppose to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and di Bodo community (and dey part-funded by di oil giant and Nigerian regulators) bin dey certified as 98% complete.
However, di BBC visit sites within di area and find say crude oil still dey smell from di soil and dey float ontop water.
Shell and di BMI insist say any occurrences of oil spills for di region na becos of theft - dem sabi in di industry as ""oil bunkering"".
""Plans dey to call back di contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,"" Boniface Dumpe, a director for di BMI, tell di BBC.
""Na di responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of dia facilities, to ensure say re-oiling no go come from dia facilities.
""But for di areas wey dey cleaned. I go think say some responsibility also dey for di community to ensure say some illegal activities no go also cause re-pollution.""
Shell say dem don take active measures to prevent oil spills wey oil bunkering cause.
Di company say: ""We don take advanced steps to prevent dis activity and di spills e dey cause including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.""
Di alleged failings in di oil clean-up come as Shell dey prepare to sell dia Nigerian subsidiary, di SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.
Some locals in Ogoniland don accuse di oil giant of ""running away"" from properly cleaning up di land and water wey dem allegedly don pollute.
Dem also fear say Shell fit still gain from di area by simply trading di oil extracted from di region in future.
""Di operations of whichever oil operator go take over di relevant pipelines go get ogbonge impact on dia day-to-day life,"" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, tell di BBC.
“Dem get incredibly little detail about wetin diz deals go lead to.
""E dey unclear how Renaissance [Africa] go act going forward. At least wit Shell we get means of holding dem to account.""
Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which dey come from di Niger Delta region.
Locals, wey dia main source of livelihood na agriculture and fishing, tell di BBC say since di discovery of oil, or wetin some refer to as ""black gold"", dia home don dey pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.
Dem say dem neva see any benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe wey blame recent oil spills for her failing crops.
""Formerly if I harvest I fit eat some wit my family and even sell some… but for di past few years I no fit get anyin E really dey bad,"" di 42-year-old tell di BBC.
