https://www.nairaland.com/1049481/how-place-targeted-ads-nairaland	Dear Ladies & Gentlemen,Thank you for your interest in advertising on the Nairaland Forum!Nairaland runs aTargeted Ad Platformwith which any Nairaland member can place adverts on the sections of Nairaland where the people he/she wants to reach are most likely to be found (for example, a political party could place ads on the politics section with it).To place ads on Nairaland, the first step is to get your ad banner designed by agood graphic designer.  Your ad banner must be borderless, 318 pixels wide, 106 pixels tall, less than 30kb in size, and in the PNG or JPG format. Once it's ready, go towww.nairaland.com/campaignand click (Upload Ad) to upload yourbanner adandlanding page, and wait for approval. (Your ad might not be approved if it's deceptive or illegal or morally questionable in some way).After your ad is approved, we will provide you with information about how to purchase advertising credits so you can freely place your ads on any section of Nairaland - including the home page. Our system is extremely simple by design.Please see ourEstimated Advertising Ratesto find out how much it'll cost to advertise on the various sections of Nairaland on the long run (prices on the short term are strongly correlated with traffic levels).

https://www.nairaland.com/1049481/how-place-targeted-ads-nairaland	How do you charge? Per click? Per impression? Per hour?We charge for approximate value delivered.  This is highly correlated with traffic on the short run.  So when there's less traffic, you pay less, and when you're charged more, it will most likely be due to an increase in traffic. However, on the long run, that's not the only factor we consider.  We have developed a robust pricing algorithm to make sure that you will always get what you pay for.What kind of ads would you not accept on Nairaland?We will reject ads that we consider to be ethically or morally questionable in one way or the other.  We reject ads for HYIPs and most MLMs because they are fundamentally unsustainable.  We reject ads for health remedies that make claims that have not been verified by NAFDAC because we know that they don't work as advertised.  We also reject some mailing list building ads because we don't want our members to be spammed. Sexual ads will only be accepted of placed in the sexuality section.Can we submit animated ads?No. This is because they are distracting. If your ads are attractive and well targeted, people will notice them without any animations.

https://www.nairaland.com/1049481/how-place-targeted-ads-nairaland	I placed my ad on a section of Nairaland but the placement has been 'pending;'for a very long time. Why?There are six advertising slots in every section of Nairaland.  This means that only six advertisers can place their ads on any section of Nairaland at the same time.  Once the six slots are full, any attempt to place ads on the same section by other advertisers will result in a pending placement.  However, once a slot is vacated by an advertiser for one of 2 reasons - manual removal or running out of ad credit - the slot will be handed over to the advertiser with the earliest pending placement.  That is, "1st come, 1st served!"How long will I have to wait for an ad slot to be vacated so my placements can be activated?It's impossible to say when an ad slot will be vacated since it depends entirely on what current advertisers choose to do.  However, we have observed that some advertisers like to pause their ads at night, while others like to do so during the weekends, especially on Sundays.What can I do while I'm waiting for my desired ad slot to be vacated by its current occupants?While you're waiting for your ad placement to become active, you should consider: (1) Placing your ad on very similar sections that have free slots and don't have a price premium, especially those that are being discounted. (2) Creating new ads to target sections that are less similar.  Please resist the temptation to remove and then resubmit pending placements. If you do that, you will be placed at the very end of the queue.Why is this issue more pronounced in the section where I want to place my ads, and what are you doing about it?We have just launched a smart algorithm that will gradually balance the demand for and supply of ad slots in the various sections of the forum.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344753/chika-ike-not-pregnant-me	OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONSOur attention has been drawn to the recent false rumors alleging that Senator Prince Ned Munir Nwoko is planning to marry Nollywood actress Chika Ike as his seventh wife and that she is pregnant for him. We categorically state that these claims are entirely baseless and a product of malicious speculation.Similarly, reports claiming he made statements about Tuface and polygamy are completely untrue. As a public figure and with his wife also being an actress, it is not unusual for bloggers seeking attention to fabricate such stories. However, Senator Nwoko is currently on a national assignment, focused on delivering on his political mandate, and has no time for distractions. This office remains available to journalists for verification of information, and we remind media practitioners of the consequences of spreading fake news. The public is advised to disregard these rumors and rely only on official statements from his office.SignedDirector of CommunicationsOffice of Senator Prince Ned Munir Nwoko

https://www.nairaland.com/8344727/lawmakers-loyal-wike-knock-falana	Federal Lawmakers Loyal To Wike Knocks Falana, Threatens Anarchy If Amaewhule Isn't Recognizedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mACJe2nMlioCOMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE RIVERS STATE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CAUCUS.Gentlemen of the press.1. We have invited you this morning to extinguish the delusion,  prevarication, lies, and the deliberate distortion of facts and judgements of courts as it affects the Rivers State House of Assembly under the leadership of Rt. Hon. Martin Amaewhule, the Governor of Rivers State.2. This has become very necessary as the governor has procured the services of some persons, including Senior Advocates of Nigeria, to turn the law and judgments of court upside down to skew public opinion to align with the Governorâ€™s position and give him a reason not to obey any judgment of court that is against him or not in his favour.3. We wish to caution Mr. Femi Falana SAN, to stop misinterpreting judgments of court. It is regrettable that a very senior lawyer of his status will be amplifying the falsehood from  non-lawyers and political merchants.Falana, lied about the dates of the judgment of Hon. Justice J.K. Omotosho and the purported defection that never took place with the intention of misleading the public.We wish to warn these false content creators and political merchants that it is very possible to continue to eat from the treasury of Rivers State without tampering with the position of the law, and the intentional misinterpretation of judgment of courts.4. For the records, there were several reliefs aside from the presentation of the 2024 budget sought by the Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewhule led Assembly before the Hon. Justice J.K. Omotosho, which included the determination of who is the speaker and members of the Rivers State House of Assembly; non interference by the governor of Rivers State with the activities and functions of the Martinâ€™s led Assembly;  protection by the Inspector General of Police to ensure adequate security for them to carry out their duties; and the disbandment of any other House of Assembly in Rivers State or Self-acclaimed Speaker other than Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewhule and the 27 members.5. All the reliefs sought by Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewhule were granted by the Hon. Justice J. K. Omotosho on the 22nd of January 2024.We hereby produce the orders of the Hon. Justice J. K. Omotosho, as affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.We refer the Press to pages 6 to 16 of the Judgement.6. Itâ€™s instructive to state emphatically that by the withdrawal of the Governorâ€™s appeal before the Supreme Court and the dismissal of the suit with cost, the judgment and all orders made by Hon. Justice J. K. Omotosho, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, takes effect immediately and forever. This, of course, includes the affirmation of Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewule as Speaker and the 27 members of the Rivers State House of Assembly as the ONLY House of Assembly of Rivers State and the directive to the Inspector General of Police to provide security to enable the Rivers State House of Assembly to continue to perform their functions without hindrance.7. We wish to call the attention of the Governor of Rivers State, that in his Notice of Withdrawal before the Supreme Court, he rightly referred to Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewule as the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly. Therefore, there is no more contest as to who the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly is. And any attempt to continue to deal with any person or forum as the Rivers State House of Assembly is not only contemptuous of the judgment of the Supreme Court but a direct call for political anarchy or social lawlessness.The shameless and contemptuous actions of giving any assignment whatsoever to anybody purporting same to be Rivers State House of Assembly other than Rt. Hon. Martins. Amaewule led House of Assembly should stop forthwith.8. The Governor of Rivers State having failed to use the Court of Justice Wali to unseat the 27 lawmakers, has initiated a plot at a Federal High Court in Rivers State to declare the seats of the Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewule and the 27 members vacant, even when a Federal High Court, Appeal Court and the Supreme Court have all affirmed Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewule and the 27 lawmakers as the only Rivers State House of Assembly.9. We are calling on the Executive Arm to execute the judgment of the Court of Appeal, affirming Rt. Hon. Martins Amaewule and the 27 lawmakers as the only Rivers State House of Assembly to avoid any breakdown of law and order in Rivers State.Signed:1- REP. Kingsley Ogundu Chinda DSSRS(Minority Leader)2- SEN. Barry Mpigi  DSSRS(NASS Rivers Caucus Leader)3- RT. HON. Dum Dekor , DSSRS(Leader, Rivers State Caucus House of Representatives.)

In cases requiring market interventions, we worked closely with regulatory authorities and security agencies, ensuring fairness and due process,â€ he explained.He urged the state government to reconsider the current strategy to prevent undue hardship on traders and protect the stateâ€™s economy.â€œA more balanced and transparent approach will enhance both security and economic stability,â€ Obi added, emphasising the need to weigh public health measures against their economic impact.https://www.google.com/amp/s/punchng.com/obi-urges-reopening-of-onitsha-markets-affected-by-drug-raid-closure/%3famphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkhgNp3qeWQ?si=AKsgUzB_9wt00qu1

https://www.nairaland.com/8344620/obi-urges-reopening-onitsha-markets	Paraman:Obi is a very foolish person for asking for this.Peter obi will never become the president of NigeriaWhat he is actually saying is that those involved in or caught dealing in illegal or fake drugs should be decisively dealt with within the confines of the law. Only the shops belonging to those culprits should be marked for closure, rather than closing the entire market and punishing innocent people who are conducting legitimate business.Most especially in this economy, it will negatively impact the livelihoods of others doing lawful business in the same market.In summary, close down the shops of those caught in illegal drug activities and deal with them, but do not shut down the entire market. Itâ€™s like punishing innocent people for a crime they know nothing aboutðŸ™‚

https://www.nairaland.com/8344620/obi-urges-reopening-onitsha-markets	The problem with vultures of babablus is that their brains have been vandalized.

Only the shops belonging to those culprits should be marked for closure, rather than closing the entire market and punishing innocent people who are conducting legitimate business.Most especially in this economy, it will negatively impact the livelihoods of others doing lawful business in the same market.In summary, close down the shops of those caught in illegal drug activities and deal with them, but do not shut down the entire market. Itâ€™s like punishing innocent people for a crime they know nothing aboutðŸ™‚use your headIt's a pure case of collateral damage, many know about those fake drugs factories but will never report it but once all their shops are lockedNext time when they get another shop n they see people selling anything fake they will go n report ASAP

The dramatic scene intensified when Speaker Meranda arrived at about 11:15 a.m., visibly emotional and shedding tears as she witnessed the heavy security presence.The crisis follows the controversial removal of former Speaker Mudashiru Obasa by 32 out of 40 lawmakers while he was in the United States. Describing his removal as a â€œcoup,â€ President Bola Tinubu and members of the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) have remained divided over the decision.Obasa has since taken legal action, filing a suit at the Ikeja High Court challenging the legitimacy of his removal. His lawyers, led by Chief Afolabi Fashanu (SAN), have sought an expedited hearing of the case, naming the Lagos State House of Assembly and Speaker Meranda as defendants.https://news360ng.com/lagos-speaker-meranda-sheds-tears-as-dss-takes-over-assembly-complex-video/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344640/donald-trump-deports-85-nigerians	TheUnited States has commenced deportation proceedings for Nigerian nationals, with 85 individuals set to arrive in Lagos, while 116 others remain in detention.The Federal Government, through the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu,has expressed concerns over the process, calling for a more humane approach.Odumegwu-Ojukwu, in a statement signed by her media aide, Magnus Eze, on Sunday, disclosed that â€œwith about 201 Nigerians currently detained in US immigration centres and about 85 cleared for deportation,â€ the government is advocating for adherence to internationally prescribed guidelines.Similarly, she reiterated the governmentâ€™s stance in a post on her official X account on Monday, titled â€œUS Deportations Begin.â€Lagos as Sole Deportation DestinationThe United States also confirmed that deported Nigerians will be flown directly to Lagos.Mills emphasised that individuals serving prison sentences in the US would be among the first group of deportees.â€œThose to be repatriated would be dropped in Lagos. There would not be room for whether it should be in Port Harcourt or Abuja.â€œThe first group will be convicted prisonersâ€”those who committed crimes and are in US prisons. Some of them are those who have clearly violated US immigration laws.â€œThey appealed but were denied yet they are still in the US. They have committed immigration crimes, people who have been ordered to leave,â€ Mills stated.Bianca expressed concerns over the emotional and financial impact of deportations on Nigerians in the US and their families, emphasising the need for humane and compliant processes.â€œWith the new administration in the US, we want a situation where there will be commitments. If there will be repatriation, we want a dignified return.â€œAt the moment, weâ€™re told that about 201 Nigerian nationals are in US immigration camps, and about 85 have been cleared for deportation.â€œWill there be any way of ameliorating their pains? This has been of great concern to not just Nigerian nationals in the US but family members in Nigeria who depend on them for survival, children whose school fees are paid for by these diasporans.â€œWe are asking as a country whether they will be given ample time to handle their assets or will they just be bundled into planes and repatriated? It will really be traumatic, especially for those who had not committed any violent crime,â€ she asked.Trumpâ€™s Immigration CrackdownThe deportation process comes as part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Donald Trump Administration. On his first day in office as the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump signed several executive orders aimed at tightening immigration policies.These include ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border.He also announced the deployment of more troops to the southern border and reiterated his pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.These policy shifts, according to multiple media reports, have heightened concerns among immigrant communities.https://punchng.com/85-nigerian-deportees-arrive-lagos-from-us-today/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344590/lagos-lawmakers-condemn-dss-invasion	Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly have condemned the invasion of the Assembly complex by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigeria Police on Monday, describing it as a â€œrape of democracy, an aberration, and a national embarrassment.â€During a plenary session attended by 36 members, the lawmakers demanded an explanation from the Lagos State Director of DSS regarding the reasons behind the invasion.They also called on the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, to investigate the incident and provide the public with a comprehensive briefing on the findings. Additionally, the Assembly urged President Bola Tinubu to intervene immediately and prevent the situation from escalating further.Expressing their outrage, the lawmakers unanimously condemned the invasion, describing it as an abuse of legislative procedure and a threat to democratic governance.Speaking during the session, Hon. Abiodun Tobun said:â€œThis is not a government ruled by the barrel of a gun. This is an aberration of democracy and a step toward anarchy. What happened today is a total embarrassment and an act of harassment.â€He further affirmed the lawmakersâ€™ loyalty to the Speaker, saying:â€œNobody can dictate to us. God chooses and removes leaders. We are solidly behind your leadership, Mr. Speakerâ€”nobody can remove you.â€The lawmakers suggested that powerful and influential individuals or groups might be behind the incident, calling for a thorough investigation to uncover those responsible.The House remained united in its stance, insisting on protecting the independence of the legislature and ensuring that such actions do not undermine democratic processes in the state.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/02/invasion-of-lagos-assembly-a-national-embarrassment-lawmakers-lament/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344560/three-policemen-arrested-extorting-100000	A team of police officers attached to the Area F of the Lagos State Police Command have been detained for allegedly extorting a Chinese expatriate along the Sheraton-Opebi link Road area of the state.PUNCH Metro learnt that the incident occurred when the officers numbering three were conducting a stop and search at the location on Wednesday.The police officers were said to have flagged down the foreigner and requested his documents, including a green card.Although the expatriate presented the documents through his phone gallery, the officers insisted on seeing the original copies.A rights activist, Lameed Adekunle, who was privy to the development told our correspondent on Sunday that after a series of discussions and pleas from the expatriate, the officers forced him to pay N100,000 into a Point Of Sale account.He said,â€œThe expatriate was on his way for an urgent meeting when the police officers stopped him and demanded his documents including his green card which was shown to the officers through a phone gallery but the officers insisted on seeing the original. Because he was unable to provide it, the officers requested N100,000 and since they did not want to get late to the meeting, they had to make the payment into the account provided to them.â€Speaking on how it became public knowledge, Adewale Ojo of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said the expatriate, who works with a popular construction company, narrated his experience to his Nigerian co-workers who later escalated the matter.He said,â€œThe man just moved to Nigeria and he felt so disappointed in the way he was treated. He had to tell some of his workers who later informed us. We took it up, informed the police authorities and the officers were identified. This also led to their arrest and detention.â€He further stated that the policemen were summoned to the provostâ€™s office in the Ikeja area of the state, adding that they had since been detained.Ojo added the police officers were instructed to refund the money to the foreigner.â€œThe money is expected to be refunded tomorrow,  Monday. We are doing this to make sure that the bad eggs in the police are fished out and we also want to follow this particular case to the end like we have always done,â€he added.In a picture sent to our correspondent, one of the officers was seen conversing with the expatriate in his vehicle.A receipt of the transfer bearing the name of the expatriate and the recipient was also seen by our correspondent.The command spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, could not be reached for a reaction as calls made to his telephone line were not answered. A text message sent to him had yet to be replied to as this report was filed.PUNCH Metro reported in October 2024 that officers from Area C Police Command in Surulere allegedly extorted the sum of N1m from three members of the National Youth Service Corps members.It was gathered that the corps members were stopped along the Surulere expressway before a group of officers surrounded their vehicle and started searching.An argument ensued between the corps members and the officers before the vehicle was driven to the Area C Police Station where the extortion was said to have taken place.https://punchng.com/three-policemen-arrested-for-extorting-n100000-from-expatriate-in-lagos/

https://www.nairaland.com/8343919/ever-rejected-job-offer-yes	I rejected one that asked me to pray in the morning. I knew about it at the final stage of the interview. That morning prayer is a trap. A psychological trap by human beings in the name of faith.Everyone should pray in their homes and come to work to work, not for worship. It happens in some government offices where people bring their personal affair with God to the office. I don't need your outward showoff to know if you're spiritual or religious, I'll see your religion through the way you treat others and make decisions at the work place. Your power to reject is based on your convictions and how experienced you are. At a younger age, you may not see clearly but life will teach you some lessons and later in life you will start to reject what poisons your soul even if it pays you billions. Be grateful for mentors or parents who can protect you and tell you to flee from some traps. Life repeats itself.When I think about life, what I see is that school never stopped. Adults just changed the venue of classrooms. People want to control you in different ways because they hold the keys to power and that is where the money is. If you don't work, you'll die so people lose their freedoms in the name of work. It's rare to see a class captain who respects you as a person not because he has the power to write your name on the list of noisemakers. The plantation never closed downAuthority is not power. Take note of that.

The Abuja crew of Arise TV are some of the most boring hosts you can find anywhere around the world, with only Ngozi Aleagbu as a sole exception.The only show one can manage to watch on the Arise TV is "The Morning Show" and Rufai Oseni is doing a good job in bastardising the programme. Sadly, the owner is not even saying anything because I think that's working for him.Even the morning show crew of Arise TV normally tune to Channels to see real professionalism at work under Seun.Channels no get competitors, unfortunately

He was in America when he was removed in a situation described as â€œcoup,â€ by President Bola Tinubu.The development has generated controversy with members of the Governance Advisory Council, GAC, an apex political decision making body in All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos, divided over Obasaâ€™s removal.Obasa, in the suit, was challenging the legality of his removal from office.The motion, made available to Vanguard Media was filed on Wednesday, 12 February, 2025, names the Lagos State House of Assembly and Mojisola Lasbat Meranda, current Speaker of the House, as defendants.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/02/dss-storms-lagos-assembly-seals-speaker-deputys-offices/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344269/does-chika-ike-child-ned	Nollywood actress Regina Daniels and her billionaire husband, Ned Nwoko seem to be going through marital troubles as speculations of a new wife arise.Regina, who recently returned from London after attending the premiere of Ayo Makunâ€™s movie The Waiter, has unexpectedly deactivated her Instagram page.A swift confirmation by Gistreel revealed that her account was no longer accessible but may be restored sooner or later.Adding to the speculation, the actress did not publicly celebrate her husbandâ€™s recent political move to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Observers also noted that she had stopped posting about him and had not been engaging with his social media updates.Amid the ongoing rumors, reports claim that actress Chika Ike, who recently announced her pregnancy with maternity photos, has welcomed a child allegedly fathered by Nwoko. According to online sources, Chika is now set to replace Regina and move into the billionaireâ€™s mansion.Controversial blogger Gistlover fueled the speculation with a cryptic post, stating:â€œHello Tueh Tueh, GLB Nation! Wahala don happen! Another senior actress don born for billionaire, little billionaire wife don run comot for Instagram. Ah, which kind wahala be this?â€While Regina Daniels and Ned Nwoko have yet to address the rumors, the sudden social media disappearance of the actress has only intensified public curiosity about the state of their marriage.https://www.gistreel.com/regina-daniels-deactivates-ig-amid-husbands-alleged-child-with-chika-ike/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344327/disregard-malicious-allegations-canada-visa	The Defence Headquarters has urged Nigerians to disregard â€œthe malicious allegationsâ€ and support the efforts of the armed forces to enhance national security and promote the welfare of servicemen and women.The Director of Defence Information, Brig.-Gen. Tukur Gusau, in a statement on Monday, faulted the allegations regarding Nigerian Militaryâ€™s request for visas to attend the Invictus Games in Vancouver, Canada.He urged Nigerians to support the officers, men and women who sustained various degree of injuries while protecting the nation.According to him, the need for accurate information at this time can not be overemphasised.Gusau said the Nigerian military received an invitation to participate in the Invictus Games with its team, that comprised of three officers and 21 players, including the teamâ€™s physiotherapist.He explained that the Invictus Games Foundation catered for the teamâ€™s accommodation and feeding needs, along with those of other participating nations.He said, â€œHowever, inspite of our best efforts, only 14 members of the team, excluding the team leader, captain, and physiotherapist, were granted visas.â€œRegrettably, seven of our athletes who had the potential to excel were denied visas, preventing them from participating in the games.â€œNotwithstanding this setback, our teamâ€™s outstanding performance earned Nigeria gold, silver and bronze medals, proudly placing our nation and Africa on the global map of Invictus Games.â€œFurthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen. Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.â€œIt is on record that the Chief of Defence Staff has initiated laudable efforts to boost morale of our service personnel who risk their lives to protect our nation and its people.â€œThe Invictus Foundation Centre, which is the first in Africa and currently under construction, is part of this initiative to provide care and mental healing for our wounded personnel.â€NANhttps://punchng.com/disregard-malicious-allegations-on-canada-visa-denial-dhq-tells-nigerians/

https://www.nairaland.com/8343779/yetunde-hafsho-lawal-she-visited	Wooow! Thourough investigation needs to be carried out! Anybody associated with this heinous crime needs to die a painful death!
https://www.nairaland.com/8343779/yetunde-hafsho-lawal-she-visited	Suit and tie on a profile picture doesn't make you a good person. But these girls have no idea.Finally, the scary part is that there are more than 500 of this guy in Naija and that's just the tip of the iceberg. They have a list high and low profile clients scattered everywhere. Even your pastor and might be in their list.
https://www.nairaland.com/8343716/jerry-eze-wearing-singlet-small	Pastor Jerry Eze wearing singlet and shorts like boxers publicly is wrong! Exposing private parts of your body(like your thighs,armpits,upper chest/back and others) in the name of exercise is wrong, inappropriate and sexually offensive to kids and young people and very unnecessary!You could wear track suits, or if u like wearing singlet and small tight shorts, why not have your own gym at home and exercise with your wife. You are seen praying for women in the gym with your barely covered body! Is that not a room for temptation for you and the ladies? Must you go to the gym with a camera man to video you? Must you also post these videos with your body barely covered? You posted this yesterday on your page which has millions of followers with many young women!Jerry must know he is a role model and idolized by many and he needs to know that to whom much is given, much is expected. He should also know some weak Christian sisters go into lust and masturbation when they see their idolsâ€™ bodies exposed! The same way men are moved into lust by exposed bodies is same for some women!1 Corinthians 8:13Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble1 Corinthians 8:9But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.Mark 9:42â€œWhoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.Daejumong 16/2/2025
https://www.nairaland.com/8343716/jerry-eze-wearing-singlet-small	Why go with your camera men to the gym to make these videos??

https://www.nairaland.com/8343716/jerry-eze-wearing-singlet-small	Not sure what you're yapping about.  Your great grand fathers wore less. That didn't make them evil. Overdressing is not a sign of sanctity. Folks wear hijab and atill do the unthinkable.. .  You dress based on your environment. You wear more if it is cold.  It is hot out here, so both the females and the males must learn to wear less.... As long as the purpose is not to reveal things that should be concealed..That said, na una wey dey allow una wives to go visit these new generation pastors I dey pity. Una shame just dey shame me. 95% of these pastors are just motivational speakers. Nothing else. Someone will wake up and start calling himself a "Bishop" or a "Man of God", and voila, my people are already falling over themselves paying tithes..God dey shaa

Your tribal people are behind U 100%. That anointing mustn't be wasted.It's time to raise another 'pastorpreneurs' for the northerners and maybe for the Arabs too.

I know I've achieved a lot and done so many good things for my family. Money is not the problem for me now, but I still feel something missing in me. My siblings and close friends are all graduates, except me.Sometimes I get shy when I'm around them, and it makes me feel sad.

And I mean a skill you can grow to an industry.The world has changed and no one cares whether you went to university or not. Just be literate that's all

https://www.nairaland.com/8344216/nigerian-salon-where-first-class	...The pay must be super handsome. But then again, this is nigeria, most things rarely make sense here

When did polytechnics start issuing grades as first class?Moreover, having a first class doesnâ€™t really mean you are the smartest in your class. Itâ€™s just that you cram more or have more time to warm your books than others.All the so called employees in that video look mentally unstable. Seems sheâ€™d already used their brains.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344216/nigerian-salon-where-first-class	And so? These are crafts that make people rich in developed countries.I don't understand the need to upload this video though.Is he trying to make gatemen and cleaners look less employed or what?These are people doing honest jobs that will take them to heaven after their earthly lives. They decided to keep it clean rather than soil their lives for millions.I am not saying they can't be better in life. But every one cannot be a millionaire or billionaire. Everyone cannot be in management.I have seen wheel barrow pushers build mansions. All they needed was a plan and a target.Coscharis motors that is the biggest distributor of German cars in Nigeria barely finished grade 6.He even doubles as the board of chairman of 2 investment banks in Nigeria.Degrees are just papers. What matters is output. What did you produce with your degree.The problem we have in Nigeria is that we have put so much focus and attention on paper certificates that produces nothing.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344216/nigerian-salon-where-first-class	Insecurity from a bitter soul is all I see here.She's trying to ridicle those wit first class degree. Her type graduated wit 3rd class or pass and swore to employ the so called "first class graduates". We no their type. Na bad belle.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344216/nigerian-salon-where-first-class	InterestingI don't know what informed the owner's decision to employ only first class holders for jobs that need little or no education. But I am ðŸ’¯ % sure school no be scam
https://www.nairaland.com/8344216/nigerian-salon-where-first-class	When you're "Theorical" first class graduate, that's bound to happen...

Why is she carrying first class ugliness around and calling it a face?

https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	Nigerians have ways of simplifying complex ideas theoretically that a two-year old will understand. But the practical that's on a long thing.So Nigerians in the diaspora are getting the theory explained by Nigerian teachers and the practical will be done in the abroad where they are residing.If you ask me, that's a two factor assurance - so brilliant. That way the child will be good at both the theory and practical.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	I did this while I was in Nigeria. I prepared a kid in year five for his Primary checkpoint English and his elder brother for his GCSE. And I often prepared others for IELTS.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	Alright.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria. I understand you might not have lived outside Nigeria, so I have no problem with your views.Most schools abroad encourage mediocrity and non ambitious learning. Many Nigerians see this gap and decide that their own child will not join the bandwagon of mediocrity and so get a teacher from Nigeria who will help push the child better with a Nigerian driven curriculum.Why do you think Nigerians top classes in UK schools for example?

https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	It's been going for a while now.As we speak I have 2 students I teach online and its going on fine. Its just that you must know your onions and be ready to adapt because of differences in the curricula of the two countries involved.  You may also need to spend money to get the necessary materials like the recommended texts and past questions.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344312/living-abroad-getting-lesson-teachers	Moreover, it's a way some teachers earn a bit more to augment poor pay from school.You'll be shocked to know that some of these teachers make more than their salary doing this and for just about 3hrs a week.Sometimes the children are grouped in classes which means the teacher can earn even more.1Hover1:Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria. I understand you might not have lived outside Nigeria, so I have no problem with your views.Most schools abroad encourage mediocrity and non ambitious learning. Many Nigerians see this gap and decide that their own child will not join the bandwagon of mediocrity and so get a teacher from Nigeria who will help push the child better with a Nigerian driven curriculum.Why do you think Nigerians top classes in UK schools for example?

It is only a ludicrous person that'd say Nigerian Teachers teach cut and join English, when it is conspicuous that we have several English Language Teachers that know their onions. Some of us that didn't study English language and aren't English language Teachers can even teach the Language well to a good extent.
https://www.nairaland.com/8344218/kano-newborn-baby-found-dead	Residents of Tudun Murtala Tagarji community in Kano State woke up to a distressing discovery of a newborn baby abandoned in a carton near the Kaura drainage.According to Commander Sulaiman Rabiu, leader of the Operation Zaman Lafiya vigilante group, his team came across the heartbreaking scene during a routine patrol around 2 a.m. on Saturday.â€œYesterday around 2 a.m., while we were out on patrol, we came across a shocking incident inside a pit very close to us. Upon close observation, we noticed a disposed carton, but we had no idea what was inside it,â€ he recounted.Determined to investigate, the team proceeded with caution.â€œIn order to clear our doubt and be sure nothing harmful was kept there, I instructed my boys to open the carton, and behold, upon opening it, we saw a baby already dead,â€ Sulaiman revealed.Following the discovery, the vigilantes took the baby to their office and informed the community leadership.â€œBy morning, we invited the ward head to come and see for himself, along with other members of the community, before conveying the baby to the police station and informing them,â€ he explained.The police later directed them to a hospital for medical examination, where doctors confirmed the baby was dead.â€œWe came back home and organized burial rites for the baby in accordance with Islamic teachings,â€ Sulaiman stated.Commander Sulaiman urged vigilante groups to remain vigilant in safeguarding their communities and called on parents to guide their children, particularly young women, to avoid circumstances leading to unwanted pregnancies.â€œUnwanted pregnancy goes against Islamic teachings, and parents should monitor their childrenâ€™s movements, with guidance from traditional leaders,â€ he advised.Source:https://dailypost.ng/2025/02/16/kano-newborn-baby-found-dead-in-abandoned-carton/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344260/uk-ready-put-troops-ground	UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is "ready and willing" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was "essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future".Before attending an emergency summit with European leaders in Paris on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"."I do not say that lightly," he wrote. "I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."The prime minister added: "But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country."The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again", Sir Keir said.UK troops could be deployed alongside soldiers from other European nations alongside the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory.Sir Keir's announcement comes after the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, told the BBC the UK military was "so run down" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.The PM has previously only hinted that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire.He is due to visit President Donald Trump in Washington later this month and said a "US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again".Sir Keir is meeting with other European leaders in response to concerns the US is moving forward with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say.On Saturday the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted only and not take part in any talks between the US and Russia.A senior Ukrainian government source told the BBC on Sunday that Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia.Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the "ridiculous war" in Ukraine would begin "immediately".Trump then "informed" Zelensky of his plan.On Sunday, Trump said that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks. He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine.Asked by the BBC about his timetable for an end to fighting, Trump said only that "we're working to get it done" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies.Writing in the Telegraph, Sir Keir said "peace cannot come at any cost" and "Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations, because anything less would accept Putin's position that Ukraine is not a real nation".He added: "We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government - in reference to a deal negotiated by Trump's first administration, which was later enacted by the Biden administration."I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too," said Sir KeirSir Keir said Ukraine's path to Nato membership was "irreversible" and European nations "must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role" in the alliance.The UK currently spends around 2.3% of GDP on defence and has committed to increase defence spending to a 2.5% share of the economy, without giving a timeframe for this.Trump has called for Nato members to spend 5% of GDP on defence, while Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has suggested allies should spend more than 3%.Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - told the BBC up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine and "we just haven't got that number available".He said, in total, a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops and the UK would have to supply "quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it".The meeting in Paris called by French President Emmanuel Macron will see Sir Keir joined by leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark along with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Rutte.https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gxgxl3grgo

https://www.nairaland.com/8344260/uk-ready-put-troops-ground	A potentially interesting turn of events. Since 1945, the UK has not had reason to oppose Russia on the battle field. Now, we are faced with a potential situation that may very well escalate. Now can the UK force project? That's unlikely as it has limited blue water navy capabilities. Can UK troops in Ukraine be a game changer? Certainly not in the way we'd like to think. Their presence there is just a trip wire that will draw in larger European forces.Emmanuel Macron is chomping at the bits to commit troops to Ukraine. Germany is heeing and hawing but will eventually commit. However, the situation needed not have gotten to this extent. The United States abdicating its responsibilities is what is forcing these countries to step up.The meeting in France today will be very interesting.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344194/not-planning-destabilise-osun-oyetola	Minister of Marine and Blue Economy,Adegboyega Oyetola has urged Governor Ademola Adeleke of Osun State to respect the Appeal Court judgement that reinstated the sacked local government chairmen in the state.Oyetola also dismissed Adelekeâ€™s claims of plotting the breakdown of law and order in the state.OSUN DEFENDER reports that the Governor while addressing a World Press Conference on Sunday had alleged his predecessor of plotting to destabilise the state.Adeleke said Oyetola was planning to use security agencies to create chaos and anarchy in Osun state over the judgement of the Appeal Court on the sacked elected Yes or No Chairmen.But, in a statement by the Media Office of the minister, a copy of which was made available to journalists on Sunday, Oyetola said he is a man of peace who has tremendous respect for the judiciary, rule of law and constituted authority, as such would never be party to any breakdown of law and order.â€œFor the four years he governed Osun, he gave a good account of himself as a man of peace, a respecter of rule of law and one not given to violence. If he is given to violence, he would certainly have fought back violently in 2022 when was brazenly rigged out.â€œAgain, in 2022, when Governor Ademola Adeleke employed extra-judicial means to sack democratically elected council officials, Oyetola as the leader of party, never preached violence. Instead, he led the party members to court.â€œThankfully, his party won at the Appeal last week. And as peace-loving leader, he appealed to security agencies to enforce the judgement of the court. How can such a man be accused of a destabilisation plot. I think anyone accusing Oyetola of violence needs to have his/her head properly examined.â€œThe minister, is further seizing this opportunity to appeal to his successor to respect the Appeal Court judgement, rather than resort to cheap blackmail, which has no place in law,â€ the statement reads in part.https://www.osundefender.com/i-am-not-planning-to-destabilise-osun-oyetola-replies-adeleke/

The court in a judgment in Tuesday ordered the immediate resumption of office of the council officials who are all members of the All Progressives Congress, APC.Meanwhile, the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission, OSSIEC, has filed an appeal against the Appeal Court judgement.The government filed an application for stay of execution, pending hearing of the appeal.DAILY POST recalls that on assumption of office in November 2022, Governor Adeleke sacked the local government officials after a High Court decision had earlier upturned their election.The High Court sacked the council officials after their election which was organised by OSSIEC.The Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and other political parties had approached the High Court to challenge the council elections.They prayed the court to declare the election as a nullity because it was only the APC candidates who contested vacant positions and the â€˜options given to them was either a YES or NOâ€™."Based on this newspaper information, there is an appeal of that judgement and stay of execution in place at the court.So why is Oyetola and his APC team in a hurry?

https://www.nairaland.com/8344171/probe-weighty-claim-usaid-funded	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY-r-AbisxYThe lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District, Ali Ndume, has asked the Federal Government to probe a claim by US Congressman Scott Perry that aborted United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded terrorist organisations, including Boko Haram.â€œYou canâ€™t say itâ€™s just an allegation; itâ€™s more than that,â€ the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army said on Channels Televisionâ€™s Sunday Politics programme.â€œThatâ€™s why the Nigerian government and the National Assembly, especially, need to look into it to investigate and verify the veracity of such a very weighty allegation.â€The lawmaker, who has been in the National Assembly for more than 20 unbroken years, said the Nigerian government should be interested in the US congressmanâ€™s revelation, considering that there had been suspicions that foreign humanitarian agencies operating in Nigeriaâ€™s insurgent-ridded North-East zone sponsored terrorist activities.Ndume said, â€œThis development is very worrisome, especially because one of the terrorist organisations mentioned by Scott Perry is Boko Haram, and Boko Haram has ravaged not only the North-East but even (other parts of) Nigeria.â€œYou can remember Boko Haram bombed the police headquarters and the UN office in Abuja, and the casualties were enormous. So, the Nigerian government must be interested.â€œIâ€™m worried, but the Nigerian security agencies have raised this indirectly several times. Even the Borno State government was wary of the operations of the NGOs.â€œI remember during the period of (Lieutenant General Tukur) Buratai, the Nigerian Army got intelligence and even raided the office of USAID or United Nations in Maiduguri. There was also a time when the governor got intelligence and security agencies raided one NGO that was providing training to some of their staff on how to use guns.â€œWe have been wondering for all these years where these people are getting money.â€Ndume further said Nigeria should be giving out humanitarian assistance to other countries and not receiving them.â€œThis issue of relying on aid from other countries is not even good for us because Nigeria, by now, is supposed to be the one that is giving out aid and not receiving aid,â€ he said.â€œThis is like a wake-up for all of us in government. We have everything; the only problem is the leadership. We need to fix that so that weâ€™ll tap into what we have and be content.â€https://www.channelstv.com/2025/02/16/probe-weighty-claim-usaid-funded-boko-haram-ndume-tells-fg/

Communications Commission was not reversed by the end of February.The union directed Nigerians to boycott the services of major telecom providers, including MTN, Airtel, and Glo, daily between 11am and 2pm starting February 13 and continuing through the month.The NLC in a communiquÃ© signed by its President, Joe Ajaero and General Secretary, Emma Ugboaja, accused the telecom operators of breaching public trust by implementing the tariff hike before the conclusion of a 10-man review panelâ€™s deliberations.The union also faulted the government for failing to protect citizens from corporate exploitation.The NLC argued that the tariff increase represented a betrayal of public trust, given the earlier agreement to establish a committee to review the proposed hike.However, the NSCDC urged the NLC to reconsider its planned protest, warning that any disruption to telecom services could expose the country to criminal activities and compromise national security.Afolabi made it clear that the agency will not allow any action that could jeopardise the security of the nation.He revealed that state commandants had been directed to maintain round-the-clock surveillance at telecom facilities, with a nationwide deployment of officers, including undercover operatives, to ensure the protection of these assets.Citing the importance of telecommunications to national security, the corps warned that any disruption could result in vandalism and other criminal activities.He added, â€œAlready, the NSCDC commandant-general has directed state commandants to maintain round-the-clock surveillance in and around all the telecom masts in their locations.â€œAlso, there is going to be nationwide massive deployment of the officers and men of the corps, including undercover and intelligence operatives, to maintain peace and ensure that all the government and corporate organisationsâ€™ critical national assets and infrastructure are protected from the miscreants who might likely use the opportunity of the planned protest to carry out their criminal activities.â€™â€™â€œAvailable credible intelligence already established the fact that the planned protest will be hijacked by hoodlums and that is why the NSCDC is on top of the situation,â€ he further stated.The NSCDC called for dialogue to resolve the dispute and hoped that the NLC would reconsider its stance.Afolabi stated, â€œThe NSCDC, under the leadership of Commandant-General, Dr. Ahmed Audi, is appealing to the organized labour under the umbrella of the Nigeria Labour Congress to shelve their planned protest of March 01, 2025 and the move to shut down telecommunication facilities nationwide.â€œAlthough peaceful protests are allowed under the law, experience and fallouts of similar threats in the past necessitate the need to appeal to the NLC not to embark on any action that will further affect the security of the country.â€œNSCDC will not fold its arms and allow any action that will expose the nationâ€™s security and eventual compromised economic stability and public safety, under the guise of protesting the increase in telecom services tariffs.â€œThe scars of similar protests that turned violent in the past are still there as reference points and the NSCDC and other security agencies in the country will not allow the miscreants, hoodlums and other non-state actors to hide under the guise of NLC protest to loot and vandalise government and corporate organisations assets and infrastructure.â€The NSCDC stressed its commitment to safeguarding the nationâ€™s critical infrastructure and stated that it is prepared to take decisive legal action against those who attempt to undermine the security of the country.â€œThe NSCDC is committed to safeguarding the lives of Nigerians and property of the government and corporate organizations we are ready to take decisive actions against any individual or group that embarks on any action that can jeopardise the security architecture of the country,â€ he added.The corps said it has placed its personnel on high alert and warned that anyone found engaging in illegal activities during the protest will be dealt with according to the law.â€œWe still believe that dialogue remains the best solution and we hope that organised labour will listen to the voice of reason and jaw-jaw with the government. We advise organised labour leaders to stay away from base stations and telecom mast locations as NSCDC personnel have been placed on red alert.â€œAnybody found wanting will be dealt with according to the stipulated law of the country,â€ the spokesperson cautioned.The Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria criticised the NLC over its planned protest.The Secretary-General of PTECSSAN, Abdullahi Okonu, told The PUNCH on Sunday that the union had already made its position clear, arguing that the increase is necessary to prevent a collapse of the industry.In a letter addressed to the NLC, PTECSSAN said the labour congress had acted â€œin errorâ€ by taking decisions without consulting the union, which represents workers in the telecom sector.â€œIt is our firm belief that the Congress Leadership has acted in error in taking these decisions without prior consultation with our union that operates in the sector,â€ the letter read.â€œPerhaps, getting in touch with us to provide you with information on the happenings in the sector would have assisted the Leadership in taking a better decision than it had taken,â€ it further said.The union acknowledged the concerns over the impact of the tariff increase on consumers but insisted that the hike was unavoidable due to rising operational costs.PTECSSAN pointed to the removal of fuel subsidy and the subsequent surge in petroleum prices, which have significantly increased the cost of maintaining telecom base stations across the country.On its part, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria urged the labour unions to suspend its planned rally, pointing out that there had been no formal engagements or discussions with the telecom operators before the unionâ€™s decision.ATCON president Tony Emoekpere criticised the planned boycott of telecom services and shutdown of infrastructure declared by the workersâ€™ union.â€œThis isnâ€™t a labour issue; itâ€™s an industry-wide challenge. Interest rates, for example, fluctuate constantly, yet banks donâ€™t shut down in protest. These economic policies affect all sectors, not just telecoms. So why single out our industry?â€ Emoekpere told The PUNCH.He emphasised that while concerns about service quality are valid, expecting businesses to operate at a loss is unsustainable.â€œIf the goal is better service, letâ€™s have that discussion. But resorting to actions that could disrupt the industry and the economy isnâ€™t the way forward,â€ he added.[quote]The telecom executive further stated that telcos are solely focused on improving services that will be beneficial to subscribers and get value for their money.But speaking with The PUNCH, the Lagos State NLC Chairperson, Funmi Sessi, rejected the warnings from the NSCDC, making it clear that Labour would not be cowed by threats.â€œNo one can threaten us â€“ no one! This is about our commonwealth, our joint heritage. Civil Defence officers are merely working for their pay, but they have no authority to dictate to us. If necessary, we will shut down the electricity itself! Who are they to tell us otherwise?â€ she declared.She further lambasted the security forces for attempting to intimidate workers, saying,â€œLet them threaten all they want, nothing will stop us. We know the song we sing: how many people will the soldiers kill? Even the police must remember to remain civil. They cannot kill us all!â€Source:https://punchng.com/Telecoms-tariff-hike-FG-deploys-security-agents-as-NLC-insists-on-protest

Fr Jude Muokwe, has allegedly beaten up a 50-Year-Old Widow, Mrs Ikeorah Maureen.The priest was said to have used a whip on the widow, flogging her mercilessly and inflicting multiple injuries on her in the process.A Video of the widow, which is already trending on social media, showed the primary school teacher crying like a baby, and displaying bodily injuries inflicted on her by the priest.The widow is said to be from Ifitedunu community in Dunukofia LGA and also a teacher in Angel Primary School, Ifitedunu, a school said to be owned and managed by the Catholic mission.Though the real cause of the incident has not been ascertained, DAILY POST gathered thatthe widow and some other staff of the school were meeting in one of the classrooms in the school over salary increment, which they planned to pass to the management, when the priest came into the classroom and flogged her mercilessly, to the amazement of everyone.When DAILY POST reached out to the priest, Rev Fr Jude Muokwe, to ascertain what truly happened,the priest did not deny the allegation. He simply said he would not like to comment on the matter.â€œI cannot speak to you, I canâ€™t speak especially to someone I do not know about this matter,â€the priest said in a sober tone.Source:https://dailypost.ng/2025/02/16/anambra-catholic-priest-allegedly-flogs-widow-for-asking-for-salary-increment/

I would have suggested that the Elders in the State should meet and discuss, but I just realised that such things doesn't exist in Igbo land, everybody here is independent and behaving as they liked, which is wrong for a society.A Priest flogging a woman and a teacher in his employ is a criminal offence. The government should step in, get the Priest arrested and prosecuted so as to serve as deterrent to others who would see it as a norm if nothing is done.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344117/nafdac-evacuates-140-tonnes-expired	The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, has evacuated 140 tonnes of expired and unregistered drugs from Aba to its office in Anambra.Mr Omoyeni Babatunji, the Deputy Director in charge of Investigation and Enforcement, NAFDAC Federal Taskforce, South South and South East states, disclosed this on Saturday.Babatunji, while briefing newsmen about the agencyâ€™s operations in Aba, said more than 178 drug samples drawn from the operation would be subjected to laboratory investigation.He said the 140 tonnes of expired drugs were evacuated from a warehouse in Umummeje, Umuocheala in Osisioma Local Government Area, which excludes products from the Ariaria International Market drug shops.Babatunji told newsmen that two warehouses located on No. 269, Sam Mbakwe Road, formerly Faulkâ€™s Road, Aba, filled with expired drugs had also been uncovered.He said staff of the agency found that the suspects took away some cartons of the expired but re-labelled drugs after they uncovered the place and went to bring in security.The NAFDAC deputy director who took newsmen round the two freshly uncovered warehouses of expired products, said the evacuation of the drugs in them would start on Saturday evening.He noted that recent discoveries of expired products being re-labelled and sent to markets has renewed the urgent call for a drug warehouse Wholesale Control Centre, CWC in Aba.He said â€œthis activity is a drive toward the achievement of Wholesale Control Centres, CWCs, as NAFDAC is now on ML3 or what we call Maturity Level 3 of the World Health Organisation, WHO."All these our activities are derived from global benchmarking tools for regulatory activities and coordinated warehouse system is part of it so we can regulate and control those drugs.â€œAnd NAFDAC has been engaging state governors of Abia and Anambra, where those centres are located, pushing for the establishment of the CWC warehouse system.â€.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344089/police-raid-two-esn-camps	The Nigeria Police Force has neutralised seven suspected members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in two separate operations in Imo State.The operations, carried out on February 8 and 9, 2025, reportedly led to the recovery of a cache of weapons, including eight AK-47 rifles, 14 pump-action guns, and assorted ammunition.According to a statement released on Sunday by Police Force spokesperson ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi,the first operation targeted an IPOB/ESN camp in Ezioha Mbaitolu, within the Umuele Umuaka Njaba Local Government Area (LGA).Adejobi explained that security operatives, working in collaboration with other agencies, stormed the hideout, neutralising two suspected ESN kingpins and recovering seven AK-47 rifles, 13 pump-action guns, and hundreds of live rounds.He said the operation successfully dismantled the camp, dealing a major blow to the groupâ€™s activities in the region.He said, "As a follow-up, police operatives moved to Nkwukwo Forest in Mbaitoli LGA, at the boundary with Ubachima Forest in Awomama Oru West LGA, on February 9. Upon arrival, the security team encountered armed terrorists who opened fire. In the ensuing gun battle, three additional ESN kingpins were neutralised."The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, each loaded with 36 rounds of live ammunition, one pump-action gun, four motorcycles, a cutlass, and various criminal charms used by the suspects.â€œMeanwhile, in another operation, on February 14, 2025, unknown armed men invaded Gobiraje Village in Suru LGA of Kebbi Stateand kidnapped one Umaru Bawa 'm' aged 60 yrs.â€ Adejobi reported that police operatives from the Kebbi State Command received the report and subsequently tracked the suspects to Tundafari Forest in the Dakingari area of the state, where they engaged in a fierce gunfight."Consequently, 4 of the kidnappers were neutralised and 1 arrested with fatal injuries while the kidnapped victim was rescued unhurt.The operatives also recovered the cash sum of Three Million Naira (N3,000,000) already paid to the kidnappers as ransom," he said.Adejobi noted that the Inspector-General of Police IGP, Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun, Ph.D., NPM, has commended the brave efforts of the operatives involved and emphasised the need for continued vigilance in the fight against crime.He said the IGP has called for increased intelligence gathering, community engagement, and prompt reporting of suspicious activities by citizens.Nlfpmodhttps://saharareporters.com/2025/02/16/police-raid-two-esn-camps-imo-kill-7-suspects-recover-n3million-cash-8-ak-47s-14-pump

https://www.nairaland.com/8344089/police-raid-two-esn-camps	Can the same proactiveness be deployed by the police to fight Boko haram? It is sad that the army has to clean up the mess that the Nigerian police created in Borno state.It should be recalled that the Nigerian army arrested Yusuf, the original founder of Boko haram and handed him in cuffs over to the police. A few days later, the police killed him claiming he exchanged fire with them. Exactly how does someone in detention and in a cell get to fire a weapon at officers?The death of Yusuf is what triggered Boko Haram to engage on all out attacks against Nigeria's security architecture. They initially focused on policemen as targets.Boko haram as we know it would have fizzled out long ago if Yusuf had not been killed. The question is, why was he killed? Whose secret would Yusuf have exposed that necessitated his death in custody?

https://www.nairaland.com/8344083/follow-due-process-deporting-nigerians	The Federal Government has called on the United States to adhere to international conventions when repatriating Nigerian immigrants, ensuring their dignity and allowing them time to settle personal affairs before deportation.Concerns Over Deportation of NigeriansMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu, made this appeal during a meeting with US Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills Jr., at her office in Abuja.She expressed concerns over reports that 201 Nigerians were currently held in US immigration camps, with 85 already cleared for deportation."We urge the United States to respect international repatriation protocols and ensure that affected Nigerians have the opportunity to retrieve their assets and return with dignity," she stated.Ambassador Odumegwu-Ojukwu further emphasized the importance of fair treatment, particularly for those who have not committed any criminal offenses.Visa Policy and Nigerian Students in the USThe minister also urged the US government to reconsider any plans to suspend the Drop Box Visa System, which many Nigerians rely on for easy visa renewal. She requested an official statement to clarify the US position.In addition, she raised concerns about the future of Nigerian students in the US and the uncertainty surrounding USAID programs, stressing the need for continued bilateral cooperation.US Response and Trade RelationsIn response, Ambassador Mills reassured the minister that the Drop Box Visa System had not been suspended but was under review.Regarding deportations, he clarified that individuals being repatriated would be returned to Lagos, with priority given to those convicted of crimes or violating immigration laws.On trade relations, the US envoy highlighted the upcoming expiration of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in September and encouraged Nigeria to push for its renewal.He reaffirmed the United States' commitment to strengthening diplomatic and economic ties with Nigeria.Crackdown on Illegal ImmigrationThe United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) identified 3,690 Nigerians among nearly two million non-citizens slated for deportation under President Donald Trumpâ€™s administrationâ€™s immigration policies.The Federal Government continues to engage with US authorities to ensure that deportation processes align with international standards and that Nigerian nationals are treated fairly.Source:The Bureau Newspaper

https://www.nairaland.com/8344049/tinubu-seeks-au-maritime-task	President Bola Tinubu has called on the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) to prioritize the establishment of a Combined Maritime Task Force to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea.Speaking at the 38th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Tinubu expressed Nigeriaâ€™s readiness to host the headquarters of the proposed task force in Lagos.Delivering Nigeriaâ€™s position on behalf of the President, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, emphasized the urgent need for collective maritime security efforts."The time has come for the African Union Peace and Security Council to prioritise the creation of a Combined Maritime Task Force for the Gulf of Guinea.I wish to announce that Nigeria would like to host the headquarters of the task force in Lagos."Nigeria Signs Strategic Agreement with AUTinubuâ€™s call for a maritime task force coincided with Nigeriaâ€™s signing of a landmark agreement with the AU to provide Strategic Sea Lift Services for peace support operations, natural disaster response, humanitarian actions, and personnel movement.Nigeriaâ€™s Minister of Defence, Badaru Abubakar, signed the agreement, under which the Nigerian Navy will provide a vessel for these operations on a cost-recovery basis.The signing ceremony was witnessed by Attorney-General and Justice Minister Prince Lateef Fagbemi, Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ikechukwu Ogalla, and Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Muhammed Muhammed.Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, the AU Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, signed on behalf of the African Union.Regional Security and Counter-Terrorism InitiativesPresident Tinubu commended the AUPSC for adopting recommendations from a recent high-level security meeting, including the decision to upgrade Nigeriaâ€™s National Counter-Terrorism Centre into a Regional Counter-Terrorism Centre.He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate for the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), which combats terrorism and violent extremism in the Lake Chad Region.Expressing concerns over Libyaâ€™s continued instability and its spillover effects on the Sahel, Tinubu urged the AU to support initiatives aimed at restoring law and order in the North African country."The Sahel cannot enjoy peace as long as Libya does not," he warned.He further highlighted the insecurity plaguing countries in democratic transition, including Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Gabon, calling for collective AU intervention.Push for African-Led Peace Operations and Economic StabilityTinubu advocated for leveraging UN Security Council Resolution 2719 to support AU-led peace operations and warned against the increasing involvement of extra-continental military forces, including private military contractors, in Africaâ€™s security matters.The President also reaffirmed Nigeriaâ€™s commitment to the African Standby Force, urging AU members to finalize the draft Memorandum of Understanding for its full operationalization.On economic matters, Tinubu backed the establishment of an African-led Credit Rating Agency (ACRA) to provide fairer and more transparent assessments of African economies, countering biases often observed in global rating agencies."An independent African-led rating agency will help provide fairer assessments of African economies and reduce the bias often observed in existing global rating agencies," Tinubu stated.He commended the African Union, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Finance for advancing the Africa Financing Stability Mechanism (AFSM), which aims to address rising borrowing costs, debt burdens, and limited access to affordable long-term financing."The establishment of the AFSM underscores the collective commitment of member states in addressing financial vulnerabilities and fostering economic resilience across the continent," he said.Tinubu concluded by emphasizing the importance of adopting the AFSM to strengthen financial stability and enhance Africaâ€™s resilience against external economic shocks.Source:The Bureau Newspaper

Keep conering everything to Lagos.There is nothing nepotistic here.By merit, within Nigeria, Lagos as the busiest maritime area is the most suitable location for such international maritime organisation.Don't forget that along side Lagos, Accra, Abidjan, Dakar (Senegal) will likely compete for this organisation.Port Harcourt, Calabar, Warri, Uyo etc are not in the same class as those West African Port cities. They will lose easily.In this sort of international contest, the President has to put Nigeria's best foot forward, and that is Lagos.Lagos is not even guaranteed to win.Many countries may prefer Accra (more central in the West African region) , or Abidjan which is more livable than Lagos.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344030/700m-delta-steel-company-sold	The Director General of the Bureau for Public Enterprises, Ayodeji Gbeleyi, on Friday, revealed that Delta Steel Company, valued at over $700m, was sold for $30m.Gbeleyi stated this while interfacing with the House of Representatives Committee on Public Assets in Abuja.â€œA company worth $700m was sold for just $30m,â€ he said, noting that under the Federal Governmentâ€™s privatisation policy, â€œ80 per cent of Delta Steel Company in Aladja, Delta State, was sold to Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd in 2005, while the government retained a 20 per cent stake.â€He explained that residential buildings and land owned by the company were used to settle workers and pensioners.After privatisation, the company reportedly used Delta Steel Companyâ€™s assets as collateral for a loan from Ecobank.The BPE DG further revealed that due to non-performance, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria acquired the assets in 2015 and sold them to Premium Steel and Mines Ltd.He accused AMCON of failing to seek clarification from BPE before selling the assets, stressing that while BPE was aware of the loan from Ecobank, it had no knowledge of three other banks listed by AMCON as creditors.The petitioners, including the Association of Concerned Residents of Camp 2, 4 and 5 of Delta Steel Company, Aladja, Warri, before the involvement of AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines in DSC assets, had been staying in the estate and plots of land which were used to settle them in line with contractual agreement.The petitioners claimed that they have been under constant intimidation and harassment by police and Army personnel since 2015, claiming to be acting on the instructions from AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines to vacate the estates.Speaking on behalf of the petitioners, Dr David Emomotimi and Richardson Osifor, said the assets AMCON acquired were assets used as collateral by Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd to obtain a loan from Ecobank which did not in any way include the residential buildings.Osifor said from the contract agreement and information at the Corporate Affairs Commission, the loan Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd obtained from Ecobank was N250m but AMCOM jacked it up to N7bn.In their submission, the representatives of AMCON, Chukwuemeka Umunakwu (AMCON legal unit), said AMCON acquired the assets of DSC used as collateral to obtain loans from four banks to prevent them from collapsing.He said AMCON acquired the assets at N22bn but sold it to Premium Steel and Mines at N32bn.Responding to the inquiry by the committee whether the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation has the receipt of payments by both BPE and AMCON in respect of sales of Delta Steel Companyâ€™s assets, the representative of AGF, Kabiru Ademola (Director, Finance) acknowledged receipt of N3bn in favour of BPE in respect of sales of 80 per cent of DSC assets to Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd.He stated that the AGF is yet to get any response from Central Bank of Nigeria regarding claim of payment of N32bn by AMCON in respect of DSC assets to Premium Steel and Mines Ltd.According to him, though AMCON claimed the money was paid to the Federation Account (TSA), the agency was unable to provide proof of payment to the committee.In his submission, Managing Director/CEO of the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, Dr. Armstrong Takang, said though MOFI oversees the management of assets and investments in the country, the agency withdrawn from the issue of Delta Steel Company as a result of many controversies.He said, â€œIf our forefathers who were less exposed and less educated would build such infrastructure and maintaining it by our contemporary leaders LovePeddler are more exposed and educated than them will be a problem, I wonder what will be the future of the country.â€Chairman of the Committee, Ademorin Kuye (APC, Lagos), said the committee whose mandate includes oversight over the use, management and disposal of all Federal Government assets within and outside the country decided to probe the purported sales of the Delta Steel Company and the controversies surrounding its acquisition by AMCON.The committee directed AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines to desist from harassing the residents of the estate in Delta Steel Company untill the investigation is concluded.Source:https://punchng.com/700m-delta-steel-company-sold-for-30m-bpe-dg/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344034/edo-panel-indicts-obaseki-lg	Panel indicts ex-Gov Obaseki, LG chairmen, PDP leaders for alleged mismanage of N96bn Council fund.The administrative panel of inquiry set up by the Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo to investigate the financial accounts of the impeached 18 Local Government Chairmen in the state between September 4, 2023 and November, 2024 has allegedly indicted the immediate past Governor of the State, Godwin Obaseki.DAILY POST reports that a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday by Fred Itua, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor also allegedly indicted some local government chairmen, leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, among others.The chairman of the panel, Solomon Imohiosen while submitting the report to Governor Monday Okpebholo, alleged that they were indicted for either mismanaging and/or diverting to private accounts, the sum of N95,080,676,687.86, being amount received from the Joint Allocation Account Committee, JAAC, by the 18 Local Government Area Chairmen for the period under review.Imohiosen listed some of the indicted persons to include the embattled chairman of Orhionmwon Local Government, Newman Ugiagbe who is also the State chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria, ALGON.Others are Ahonsi Ogiegbaen Osifo, Eric Agbonmwanre, Abraham Burma and Dickson Imasogie Notiemwenmwan.He alleged that the ALGON chairman used his hotel, the Demarriots Hotels Limited in collusion with others to loot Local Government funds.He further alleged that findings and forensic investigations uncovered that the N96 billion was either mismanaged and/or diverted to private accounts.According to him, the panel observed that N95,080,676,687.86 was received from the Joint Allocation Account Committee, JAAC, by the 18 Local Government Area Chairmen for the period under investigation. However, the funds were not judiciously utilized as no meaningful projects were on the ground to justify the amount received.â€œThe panel established a case of fraudulent diversion of Local Government funds to political godfathers in the state. It was discovered that over N10,433 658,452.00 billion was fraudulently siphoned, using the pseudo name, â€œSecurity, Environment and Trainingâ€.â€œThe 18 Local Government Area Chairmen contributed the amount to the account, using it as a conduit pipe to drain government resources, as monies were transferred from there to various individuals and companies.â€œThe panelâ€™s investigation uncovered significant irregularities in the financial activities of the 18 Local Governments Councils. The recommendations outlined in the report aim to address these issues and promote transparency and accountability in the Local Governments finances.â€œThe report indicted former ALGON chairman, Oghomwen Newman Ugiagbe, who used his hotel, Demarriots Hotels Limited, Ahonsi Ogiegbaen Osifo, Eric Agbonmwanre, Abraham Burma and Dickson Imasogie Notiemwenmwan to loot Local Government fundsâ€, he alleged.Imohiosen, however, noted that the panel faced different challenges during the course of the assignment, which included late submission of financial records by various Local Government Councils, incomplete submission of records.Other challenges, he listed are deliberate obstruction of the investigation by Council personnel who failed to comply on time, but brought hefty sacks as an after-thought to dazzle panel members.In his remarks after receiving the committeeâ€™s report, Governor Okpebholo vowed that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, would prosecute those indicted for allegedly looting the Local Government treasuries, running into over N95 billion.Okpebholo, who said, he would personally petition the EFCC on the findings of the report for immediate prosecution, assured that he would go after those indicted to retrieve what they have stolen from the people of Edo State.â€œI want to thank you for a job well done. I carefully listened to the submission of the report. The truth is that the administration of former governor Godwin Obaseki took Edo people for granted. They took everything belonging to Edo people and channeled it for their personal gains.â€œWe thank God for helping us to change the narrative to benefit Edo people. We also thank the President of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, because without his support, we will not be witnessing the kind of development we are experiencing in Edo today.â€œA lot has happened. The Peoples Democratic Party looted the treasury of the Local Governments and stole our collective patrimony, and nobody went after them or took action. This time, things are different. We will go after them and retrieve what they have stolen from Edo people.â€œThey will be made to pay for it. I will personally take this document to the EFCC and ensure that justice is done for this wrong done to Edo people.â€œBesides the impeached Local Government Chairmen who were indicted by the report, former governor Godwin Obaseki, leaders of the factional Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), among others, were also fingered.â€œThe days of financial recklessness and lack of transparency in public office were long over, as â€œNigerians need to start demanding accountability from elected public office holders. This is the only way to fight corruption and ensure developmentâ€, he said.DAILY POST recalls that Governor Okpebholo had on December 18, 2024 set up the Administrative Panel of Enquiry to investigate the financial dealings of the impeached 18 Local Government Chairmen in Edo State.Source:https://dailypost.ng/2025/02/16/panel-indicts-ex-gov-obaseki-lg-chairmen-pdp-leaders-for-alleged-mismanage-of-n96bn-council-fund/

https://www.nairaland.com/8344037/macron-reportedly-calls-urgent-meeting	French President, Emmanuel Macron has reportedly scheduled an â€œemergency meetingâ€ for European leaders to discuss United States President Donald Trump.Fox News, citing Politico, reports that Polish Foreign Minister RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski on Saturday made an allusion to the meeting at the Munich Security Conference.According to the report, two EU officials told the Politico that the meeting would take place on Monday.â€œIâ€™m very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris,â€ Sikorski was quoted as saying, noting that the event would involve talking about the implications of Trumpâ€™s actions â€œin a very serious fashion.â€Sikorski has not shied away from discussing US politics in the past.He previously compared President Joe Bidenâ€™s poor debate performance to the decline of ancient Rome, while at other time said Trump was right to say that NATO countries need to spend more on their own defense.The report further noted that Macron has been cordial to Trump since the latterâ€™s reelection in November last year.The French leader had, in a post on X, expressed a willingness to work with Trump.â€œCongratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,â€ Macronâ€™s post read. â€œReady to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.â€Macron said it was â€œan honorâ€ to host Trump in December, when he visited Paris to witness the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.Source:https://dailypost.ng/2025/02/16/macron-reportedly-calls-urgent-meeting-for-world-leaders-to-discuss-trump/

The question has to be asked, if a president were a Russian asset, what would he do differently than Mr. Trump? You'd be hard pressed to find an answer.Every policy position Mr Trump has, seems to benefit Russia in some way. It is alarming that for the first time in over 80 years, the leaders of Europe are having to meet over concerns about the United States president.There is no purpose, no reasonably thought out objective, no tact nor plan to any of Mr Trumps actions or words. Just plain undistilled chaos. Chaos that seeks to upend decades of established global order and hegemony in pursuit of nothing other than the base and primordial desires of the russian lackey in the white house.

https://www.nairaland.com/8344027/binance-bribery-saga-opposition-leaders	Binance Bribery Saga: Opposition leaders defend Ribaduâ€™s integrity as Gambaryan insists on accusations.The opposition leaders said Mr Ribadu is a man of integrity and incapable of the allegations levelled against him.Two outspoken members of opposition groups in Nigeria have expressed support for National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu, following a series of allegations levelled against him by Binanceâ€™s head of financial crime, Tigran Gambaryan.The opposition leaders said Mr Ribadu is a man of integrity and incapable of the allegations levelled against him.On Friday, Mr Gambaryan accused the NSA of seeking to personally benefit from Nigeriaâ€™s dispute with Binance.â€œRibadu emphasised that he wanted billions in payouts to fund his future political ambition,â€ Mr Gambaryan said.The crypto firmâ€™s official also claimed that Mr Ribadu hired a US law firm to negotiate his release from detention while in Nigerian custody but the move failed due to their â€œincompetence and greed.â€Mr Gambaryan, who was detained and tried in Nigeria for several months, made these allegations on Friday in a series of post on X.Mr Ribadu has not reacted to the allegations. However, the Nigerian government, in its Friday response, accused Mr Gambaryan of making false claims.Information Minister Mohammed Idris said the â€œallegations are not only unsubstantiated but also lack credibility, given his apparent motive to discredit and intimidate those who ensured he faced justice.â€In response, the American insisted, on Saturday, that what he said was factual.â€œWhat I shared was factual, based on my personal experiences and conversations with those who have direct knowledge of the events I discussed.â€He added that he shared the information with both Nigerian and US law enforcement.Opposition reactA former Nigerian senator, Ben Murray-Bruce, said he believes the allegations against Mr Ribadu are â€œfalse and baseless.â€â€œI have known Mallam Nuhu Ribadu my entire life, and I can say with absolute certainty that he is incapable of the allegations being levelled against him,â€ Mr Murray-Bruce, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said. He also challenged the Binance official to undergo a â€œlie detector testâ€ in a neutral country if believes the claims he has made.â€œIt is exhausting to witness individuals repeatedly dragging Nigeriaâ€™s name through the mud with baseless accusations and fabricated evidence,â€ Mr Murray-Bruce said.He said individuals like Mr Gambaryan â€œmust be decisively dealt with, ensuring that such reckless fabrications are not only exposed but also serve as a warning to other deceitful actors who seek to undermine Nigeria.â€In his reaction, a former PDP member and counsel to various opposition groups, Deji Adeyanju, said he believes the allegations against Mr Ribadu are â€œpolitically sponsored lies.â€ He said some politicians feel â€œthreatenedâ€ that Mr Ribadu has an ambition to be Nigeriaâ€™s president. The NSA has not publicly announced such ambition.â€œYou can say anything against Nuhu Ribadu but not the issue of stealing public funds or demanding bribes from any human being. Ribadu will never steal $1,â€ Mr Adeyanju said.No More CommentOn Saturday, Mr Gambaryan said he is not going to provide more commentary on his Nigerian experience.â€œI donâ€™t want to see my kids cry because Iâ€™m not around. I donâ€™t want to see videos of my 75-year-old mother on television in tears. I donâ€™t want to see my wife crying on TV.

https://www.nairaland.com/8343985/core-north-moves-unseat-tinubu	Northern leaders have been divided over the possible re-election of President Bola Tinubu in 2027. Findings by Sunday PUNCH revealed that the once monolithic North is now split, with core northerners determinedto oust Tinubu in 2027, while northern minorities support his re-election.Our correspondents noted that although core northerners complain about the Presidentâ€™s unfavourable disposition towards the region, minority groups argue that they have fared well under his administration.The Middle Belt, southern Kadunaresidents, Hausa Christians of Northern Nigeria, and many natives of Plateau State have distanced themselves from the plot to unseat Tinubu.However, core northerners, represented by various political, socio-cultural, and indigenous groups, insist that Tinubu does not deserve a second term.The division among northern stakeholders is evident in social media exchanges between former Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, and a human rights activist, Senator Shehu Sani, who frequently express differing views on Tinubuâ€™s approach to northern issues, particularly security.The Arewa Consultative Forum, a key political and cultural association in Northern Nigeria, alongside several prominent northern figures, said the region could not be coerced into re-electing Tinubu.Speaking with Sunday PUNCH , the Secretary General of the group, Murtala Aliyu, stated that the forum remained nonpartisan and would not support or oppose any candidate.The ACF was responding to a recent statement by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Ganduje, who urged northern politicians with presidential ambitions to abandon their aspirations because Tinubu would serve for two terms.â€œWhat we normally do at ACF is to highlight critical issues that the people should consider when choosing a candidate, irrespective of their political party. We do not involve ourselves in promoting or antagonising any candidate,â€ Aliyu said.The League of Northern Democrats, a northern group comprising members of the APC, the Peoples Democratic Party, and the New Nigeria Peoples Party, vowed to support an alternative candidate in 2027. The spokesperson for the group, Ladan Salihu, said,â€œWe donâ€™t have a personal agenda against Tinubu, but we believe his government has not delivered. The performance indicators do not add up to justify northern support.â€œThe government has not met expectations, and we in the North are not convinced he deserves another opportunity. Even those who voted for him are now filled with regret.His administration has brought hardship, poverty and agony to the people. â€œNo northerner with a conscience can claim to be impressed with Tinubuâ€™s performance. He may have the best intentions, but the system he is working with is flawed and unsustainable. It cannot deliver on the promises he made to the North.â€Salihu also hinted at the possibility of a new political movement to field a northern candidate against Tinubu in 2027. â€œYes, there is a possibility, because we are not convinced that this government can lift Nigeria out of its current predicament,â€ he said.Similarly, the National Coalition of Northern Groups warned that the North would not vote for Tinubu if economic conditions did not improve. In an interview with Sunday PUNCH , the coalition president, Jamilu Charanchi, stated that the North, which holds the majority of votes, would not re-elect Tinubu if economic hardship persisted.â€œIt is the people who will decide who leads the countryâ€”there is no doubt about that. The North has a majority. It is up to President Tinubu to make the right decisions so that people will re-elect him.If he continues on this path, I can tell you clearly that people will not vote for him,â€ he said. Urging Nigerians to vote wisely, Charanchi advised the electorate to choose leaders based on competence, capacity, integrity and adherence to the rule of law. He said,â€œNigerians should not allow themselves to be manipulated by politicians. They should vote based on merit and mobilise others to elect leaders who will lift the country out of its current crisis.â€Charanchi described Gandujeâ€™s comment as troubling and disheartening, stating that it indicated the APC chairman was out of touch with reality.â€œIs he satisfied with Nigeriaâ€™s failing economy? Does he believe these failures are acceptable or justified?â€ he asked.A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, had previously hinted at northern efforts to remove Tinubu in 2027. Lawal recently declared his intention to work with El-Rufai to prevent Tinubuâ€™s re- election.In an interview, Lawal blamed Tinubuâ€™s economic policies for worsening poverty and hardship in Northern Nigeria.â€œThe North is seriously mobilising with a consensus that Bola Tinubu must step down in the 2027 election. There is no doubt about this consensus.â€œI may not have always agreed with El-Rufai, but on this issue, I will join him to stop Tinubu from winning the 2027 election. If Tinubu wins, northern Nigeria will turn into one large refugee camp,â€ he said.El-Rufai, on Monday, shared on his X handle an opinion by a chieftain of the party, Uche Diala, who warned that if Tinubu was not careful, he might face the same fate as former President Goodluck Jonathan ahead of the 2027 election.The article stated, â€œI have read and heard the arrogant posturing and braggadocio by some people who I refer to as political rabble-rousers, but I get more worried each day as it keeps looking more and more like a movie we had seen before.â€œMay I remind some persons that, more than the performance or lack thereof of the President Goodluck Jonathan administration, it was his attitude, and that of people around him, towards the North that ultimately brought him down and by extension the PDP that had boasted that it would rule Nigeria for 60 years.â€El-Rufai himself had on his X handle criticised the APC, lamenting the lack of internal democracy and active party structures within the party.He wrote â€œI no longer recognise the APC. No party organ has met in two yearsâ€” no caucus, no NEC, nothing. You donâ€™t even know if it is a one-man show; itâ€™s a zero-man show.â€However, the Northern minorities distanced themselves from the plot to oust Tinubu.One of the notable northern minority groups, the Middle Belt Forum, stated that the region had decided to support a southern presidency in 2027.The MBF argued that the region had received a better deal under the current administration than under former President Muhammadu Buhari, despite prevailing economic hardships.According to the MBFâ€™s spokesman, Luka Binniyat, the Middle Belt has secured more political appointments at thenational level and more infrastructural projects than under the previous government.Sunday PUNCH noted that Middle Belt indigenes in Tinubuâ€™s administration include the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume (Benue State), and the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management, and Social Development, Prof. Nentawe Goshwe Yilwatda (Plateau State).â€œWe are having a better deal under Bola Tinubu than under Buhari, even though we are all experiencing economic hardship like everyone else.â€œThe Middle Belt Forum, for sure, still stands for a southern presidency in 2027. So, it is up to President Tinubu to up his game to attract the Middle Belt when an alternative candidate emerges in 2027,â€ Binniyat said.Similarly, indigenous Hausa Christians of Northern Nigeria dissociated themselves from the plot to remove Tinubu in 2027, stating that they would not be pressured into making a decision that could negatively impact the social well- being of their people.According to the Christian group, Tinubuâ€™s administration had demonstrated a commitment to addressing the insecurity that has plagued many northern states.â€œAll we want at the moment is inclusivity, as we have many qualified individuals and seasoned politicians capable of holding political office.â€œInstead of calling for the Presidentâ€™s removal in 2027, we are urging him to consider some of our people for appointments, as we refuse to inherit anyoneâ€™s enemies,â€ said the National Chairman of the group, Daniel Musa.Some indigenes of Plateau State also declared support for Tinubuâ€™s second term. Speaking with Sunday PUNCH under the auspices of the Plateau Initiative for the Development and Advancement of the Natives in Jos, the indigenes acknowledged the Presidentâ€™s contributions to the development of their region. The associationâ€™sSecretary General, Dickson Auta, said,â€œHe (Tinubu) has indeed shown that he is a detribalised leader because he has been striving to spread developmental projects across every part of the country.â€œOur people are only concerned about good governance, and if Mr President continues on this developmental path, I am sure our people will have no choice but to support his ambition in 2027 should he decide to run for a second term.In fact, we are already supporting him.â€ Also, the Southern Kaduna Peopleâ€™s Union commended Tinubu for appointing individuals from Southern Kaduna to key positions.A spokesperson for SOKAPU, Josiah Abraks, cited the appointment of Gen. Christopher Musa as Chief of Defence Staff and the establishment of the Federal University of Applied Science, Kachia, as examples of the Presidentâ€™s inclusivity, which has benefited the people of Southern Kaduna.â€œThe southern part of Kaduna is willing to partner with whoever is ready to work with us to ensure our growth and development,â€ he added.https://punchng.com/north-divided-over-tinubu-re-election-as-leaders-take-sides/
https://www.nairaland.com/8343985/core-north-moves-unseat-tinubu	Middle Belt is in the bag already, the pity votes and religious sentiments Obi got from there during the last election is dead and buried.As for the Arewa Consultative Forum, they are Atiku's boys, they supported him during the last election and they lost. Their opinion is therefore inconsequential. Is it not the same NE and NW that people are decamping to APC everyday. As a matter of fact, present APC under Tinubu has become even bigger and stronger than under Buhari. They say Buhari was the only one pulling APC together and after he leaves office, APC would split but today, the reverse is the case. In 2027, Tinubu will collect 25% in 10 states out of the 13 states in the core North. It is done and dusted.After God, na Tinubu ðŸ’ª God bless Nigeria

https://www.nairaland.com/8343912/lagos-serves-48-hour-quit-notice	The Lagos State Government has issued a 24-hour quit notice to illegal traders and occupants under the Idumota, Ebute Ero Police Police overhead, and environs in Lagos Island to vacate due to violations of environmental laws and degradation.Meanwhile,the state government also ordered the immediate unsealing of the Oke Arin/Gorodom Market, following a mutual agreement reached.The market was shut down over environmental degradation and encroachment on drainage alignments.Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources,Tokunbo Wahab, gave the directives on Sunday during an on-the-spot assessment of the compliance level in the affected markets.Wahab, therefore, warned that failure of the affected occupants to vacate the area within the stipulated period of grace would attract severe consequences.The Special Adviser on Environment, Engr. Olakunle Rotimi-Akodu, Permanent Secretary, Office of Environmental Services, Dr. Gaji Omobolaji; Permanent Secretary, Office Drainage Services, Engr. Mahamood Adegbite; Managing Director Lagos State Waste Management Authority, LAWMA, Dr. Muyiwa Gbadegesin, as well as some ministry management staff, were also part of the inspection team.According to Wahab, â€œWe have come to inspect the level of compliance with respect to the directive given to keep off our drainage alignments and remove every impediment around the alignment.â€œWe came here about three weeks ago; we could see the high level of encroachment where people were selling on the drainage itself. It was a very unpalatable sight to behold.â€œThis led to serving the traders notices to vacate, and we had to re-establish that drainage and the right of way. All the connecting tertiary drainages were also opened up.â€œWe also engaged with the traders upon which they gave their written undertaking and agreed to maintain what we have opened up, which led to the immediate unsealing of the market.â€œFrom there, we inspected the Idumota and environs.We could see the level of environmental degradation and itâ€™s not something we want to keep unaddressed.â€œWe had to serve them quit notice to remove them and after then we shall do the needful.â€He stressed the need for residents, including traders at all markets, to prioritize environmental cleanliness to prevent the spread of diseases.â€œIt is necessary for everyone to take care of the environment; the traders caused the closure of the market; the government will not let down its guards. Going forward, we are determined to go around nooks and crannies of Lagos State to re-establish our drainage alignments in order to avoid flooding because whenever there is a flood in the state, you people will accuse the government of being irresponsible,â€ he said.Wahab explained the illegal process in which shop owners/ traders had converted the setback of the drainage channels in the markets to stalls had impeded the free flow of stormwater and could lead to serious disease breakouts of Cholera, Diarrhea, typhoid fever, amongst others, saying if each and everyone make good sanitation practices a daily affair in their shops and environs, it would save the citizenry from continuous visit to the hospitals.â€œWith these illegal stalls and shops, if proper care is not taken, we can have a major disease outbreak, and these outbreaks can have negative impacts on our health care system, such that we would start undertaking various tests which we can avoid by doing the needful in every corner of our stallsâ€ he said.He recalled that the State Government had banned styrofoam over a year ago due to its adverse effects on human health and drainage channels. He observed that some traders are still using and littering the market environment with the banned item and urged them to stop.â€œI would like to appeal to our traders who still engage in selling styrofoams packs that we donâ€™t want to see styrofoams in our markets; it is obvious that some of you are still storing these styrofoams in your stores; It is high time you collaborate with the government as traders to help protect the environment and all the drainage alignmentsâ€ he stressed.Wahab emphasized that Global warming and climate change is real as such everyone must become responsible in order to push back the climate challenges and effects as much as possible.â€œLet us make our choices now; markets are not meant to be sleeping places. If You people have been collecting money from those sleeping in the markets in the past, such people should stop giving you money. The government is not asking for your money; just fix the little necessary things in your corners; stop connecting your sewage system to the drainage alignment; stop discharging your waste into the drainage alignment. Stop building on the drainage alignment so that the drainages can remain clean always; the rains are coming, and we must be prepared,â€ he added.During the tour,the Commissioner also ordered the immediate sealing of Kabaran Global Nigeriaâ€”Apogbon Truck Park on Adeniji Adele Road after the expiration of several abatement notices served, stressing that the contractor that would repair the major road is expected to move to the site and that the space had been allocated for the contractorâ€™s use.The Commissioner sounded a note of warning again to developers and residents who are fond of dumping building materials on the roads and drainage channels, thereby causing serious blockage to the natural flow of water, to desist from such acts while ordering the immediate sealing of a shopping complex under construction along Adeniji Adele Road.In an appreciation response, Alhaja Basirat Owolewa, who spoke on behalf of the Iyaloja of Gorodom Market, expressed appreciation to the government for opening up all blocked drainage channels in the market.She promised that traders in the market and around the re-established channel would be compelled to promote good sanitation practices and make it a priority from now on.https://www.vanguardngr.com/2025/02/lagos-serves-48hr-quit-notice-to-illegal-traders-at-idumota-ebute-ero/

https://www.nairaland.com/8343894/boko-haram-iswap-resume-fighting	This is not the first time the Bakura Doro-led faction of Boko Haram and ISWAP engaged in such violent fighting on the islands of Lake Chad Basin.by Yakubu MohammedTwo weeks after a failed reconciliation move between Jamaâ€™tu Ahlis Sunna Liddaâ€™awati wal-Jihad (JAS), popularly known as Boko Haram, and its breakaway faction, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), both groups have resumed fighting in Abadam Local Government Area of Borno State.This is not the first time the Bakura Doro-led faction of Boko Haram and ISWAP engaged in such violent fighting on the islands of Lake Chad Basin.The recent clash, according to Zagazola Makama, a counterinsurgency expert in the North-east, occurred on 14 February around ISWAP camps in Toumbun Gini and Toumbun Ali.Mr Makama, in an X post, said ISWAP suffered heavy casualties in the battle that was fought on water. He said the fighting may continue and spread to Kukawa LGA, where Boko Haram fighters continue their campaign against ISWAP.Both groups have been fighting each other since ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.Abubakar Shekau, a former idiosyncratic leader of JAS, had, in 2015, pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), making him the leader of ISWAP.However, ideological differences forced some top members of the group, including Habib Yusuf, the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, to fall out with Mr Shekau.The breakaway faction led by Mr Yusuf, otherwise known as Abu Musab al-Barnawi, went ahead to bear the name ISWAP with its operational bases in the islands and shores of the Lake Chad basin, restricting their brothers-in-arms to places like Sambisa and Mandara Mountain in Gwoza.The genesis of the infightingWhen the groups first split in 2016, the Islamic State tried all it could to reconcile them, but the negotiation failed majorly as a result of Mr Shekauâ€™s ideological stance, especially on who should be regarded as a kufar [apostate] and why they must be executed.That same year of the schism, the Islamic State officially recognised Mr Yusuf as the leader of ISWAP. This situation forced Mr Shekau and some of his loyalists to revert to his JAS designation.Subsequently, a clash between ISWAP and Boko Haram led to the death of Mr Shekau, who experts believe killed himself to escape ridicule after his Sambisa hideout was raided on 19 May 2021. This ended Mr Shekauâ€™s 11 years of terror campaign.As the shadowy Bakura Doro succeeded Mr Shekau, supremacy fights between both groups continued, diminishing their strengths. This is besides strategic military offensives against the groups, although it is believed that these rivalry fights have killed more insurgents than military offensives.The failed reconciliationTwo weeks earlier, Mr Doro wrote a letter to the ISWAP leadership, seeking reconciliation between both groups, said Malik Samuel, a researcher with a deep understanding of jihadi groups in northeastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin region.PREMIUM TIMES could not get a copy of the letter written by Mr Doro. But Mr Samuel said insiders told him the letter was about reconciliation.He explained that ISWAP set up a committee to look into the request before the current clash.A Borno-based journalist who has been reporting on violent extremism in the North-east corroborated Mr Samuel, saying the reconciliation process failed.â€œThe ongoing clash may not be unconnected with the failed peace deal,â€ the journalist, who asked not to be named for his safety, said.Although the ISWAP has always been open for reconciliation with Boko Haram since the death of Mr Shekau, the move has always failed due to differences in beliefs, such as the treatment of civilians who do not believe in jihad.As the rivalry continues, both groups now resort to guerilla tactical attacks, deploying IEDs of various types to hit their targets. According to experts, this shift in operational pattern shows a significant combat weakness within the groups.But that does not mean the state actors have won the war. Our correspondent understands that groups, especially ISWAP, intensify their endearing strategies in the local communities they control. Noting that more than 35 million people need support because of the instability in Lake Chad that has claimed thousands of lives, the European Union recently allocated â‚¬201 million in humanitarian aid for Sahel and Lake Chad countries.The renewed clash between the two groups, according to Mr Samuel, is â€œa winâ€ for the Nigerian authority and other regional governments around the Lake Chad region.â€œHad the reconciliation worked out between them, it would have been somewhat devastating to the Nigerian military and other regional forces,â€ Mr Samuel opined, noting that rivalry clashes between the groups decimate more than the ongoing military operations in the North-eastWhen asked what could have prompted Boko Haram to write a reconciliation letter to ISWAP, the researcher explained that it may be due to the international recognition that ISWAP enjoys.â€œIt is not because of economic or funding issues,â€ he explained. â€œBoko Haram since before the death of Shekau has its funding model. They thrive on taxation of local fishers, herders and farmers.â€According to him, Boko Haram might be envious of last yearâ€™s scenario when Islamic State sent foreign instructors to train ISWAP fighters, including minors, in December.https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/774719-boko-haram-iswap-resume-fighting-after-failed-reconciliation-move.html
https://www.nairaland.com/8343894/boko-haram-iswap-resume-fighting	A great scripture that fits this scenario is 2 Chronicles 20:22-24, where Israelâ€™s enemies turned against each other and destroyed themselves:2 Chronicles 20:22-24 (NIV)"As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated. The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them. After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another. When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped."

https://www.nairaland.com/8343967/labour-party-ndigbo-zoned-2027	2027:Labour Party still available for Ndigbo to realise presidency - AbureLP zoned presidential ticket in 2023 to SouthEast to wipe their tearsThe national chairman of the Labour Party, Barrister Julius Abure has said that the party is still ready and available to support Ndigbo to realise their ambition of ruling the country in future.The national chairman who said that the Labour Party has no regret zoning the presidency to the Southeast however tasked the leaders of the zone on the need to pursue realignment with other sections of the country and to also priorities unity and togetherness to be able to win presidential election in 2027.Abure who spoke yesterday in Abuja at the Labour Party rally organized by the South East party members in Abuja ahead of the Area Council election slated to hold early next year also assured aspirants who came in their numbers that the party will not impose candidates on them.According to Abure,"Before 2023 general election, I used to believe erroneously that Igbos were not united but by the time Peter Obi joined the party and I had the privilege of campaigning for him across the wards and across Nigeria, I discovered that the Igbos are the most united, most formidable, most industrious, most hardworking and most fearless, and that is why today, I have no regrets that in spite of all odds, we zoned the presidential ticket of our party to South East."We decided that we are going to clean the tears of the Igbos. And we powerfully and courageously did that in 2023 general election. But I think that the Igbos must also go back to the drawing board."The Igbos need more realignment with the other sections of the country. Over the years, students of history will agree that the Yorubas at some point were like the Igbos who were doing it all alone and they were unable to capture power.  Before during and after independence, the Yorubas couldn't make it to the presidency but when they realigned, it was easy for them to make it to the presidency. It is a lesson for the Igbos to learn."I also think that the Igbos should be strong, firm and united with a leadership. I still believes that the Igbos still need to be more united and speak with one voice. I know that every body might not need to be together but to a very large extent, we need to be together, unity of purpose to be able to realise the dreams of the Igbos. I want to assure you that Labour Party is till ready and available to be able to support Ndigbo to realise the ambition of ruling the country in future."Barrister Abure also assured the aspirants that Labour Party is better than any other party in Nigeria. He said that the coming election in FCT will be between Labour Party and others. He assured them that the primaries will be credible, free and fair and that the Labour Party will not have anointed candidates."The reason why Nigeria and other political parties are in trouble is because leaders always want to subvert the wishes and aspirations of the people. I as the National Chairman of the Labour Party will stand to discourage that in our party. So in this coming election, only members of the party will be the ones that will determine who becomes the candidates of the party."SIGN:Obiora IfohNational Publicity SecretaryLabour Party16-02-2025https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1BLQMVAUok/

https://www.nairaland.com/8343867/asake-leaves-ybnl-question-loyalty	TrendyBeatzanalyzes Asake's exit of YBNL!When whispers about Asake's departure from YBNL began circulating in December, it felt inevitable. The label that turned the young upcoming artiste from the streets of Lagos into a global Afrobeats phenomenon in just two years might be losing its prized asset. Born Ololade Ahmed,Asakehad spent a decade as an underground hustlerâ€”dabbling in dance, churning out music, and barely moving the needle. His fortunes changed in 2022, thanks to an introduction facilitated by his friend, Yhemo Lee, to the godfather of Nigerian street-pop, Olamide.Olamidedidnâ€™t just sign Asake; he threw the entire weight of YBNL behind him. From co-signs on tracks like Omo Ope to roping in Burna Boy for Sungba (Remix), Olamide went all in. The visionary business partnership between YBNL and Empire ensured Asake's music reached farther shores, making him a staple in UK and US Afrobeats circuits. Add TG Omoriâ€™s cinematic visualsâ€”eight in totalâ€”and you have the makings of an unstoppable cultural force. Asakeâ€™s journey seemed like a perfectly executed blueprint for success.But success has a way of complicating relationships. The signs were clear when Lungu Boy, his third project, dropped in 2024. Olamideâ€™s fingerprints were noticeably absentâ€”no guest verses, no songwriting credits. The project felt disconnected, starkly contrasting the laser-focused cohesion of Mr. Money With The Vibe and Work of Art. And when reports emerged that Olamide had offered an improved deal, only for Asake to decline and choose independence, the rupture felt complete.Is It Time to Fly Solo?From a legal standpoint, Asake has every right to leave YBNL if his contract has expired. It's a business arrangement with a beginning and an end. But morality? Thatâ€™s where things get murkier. YBNL gambled on Asake, poured resources into his career, and turned him into a global brand. For Asake to exit now, just as the label is poised to recoup its investments and enjoy the fruits of their labor, feels rather ungrateful.The Double Standards of SuccessItâ€™s hard to ignore the hypocrisy that often surrounds conversations like this. If Asakeâ€™s career had faltered, no one would bat an eye at his decision to leave YBNL. The narrative would likely shift to how YBNL didnâ€™t do enough to support him. Success, however, changes the stakes. Now, his departure is framed as betrayal, a refusal to honour the loyalty that brought him to the top. This isnâ€™t unique to Asake. Wizkidâ€™s departure from EME, Burna Boy leaving Aristokrat Records, and even Davido setting up his own DMW after a brief stint with HKNâ€”these stories all follow a similar arc. For Asake, the perception is different. Heâ€™s barely two years into his reign, and the decision to leave feels premature to some, calculated to others.A Gamble on IndependenceGoing independent is not for the faint-hearted. It requires a robust team, deep pockets, and a strategy that extends beyond the next hit single. Yes, Asake now has the visibility and financial muscle to chart his own course, but he also risks losing the structure and guidance that YBNL provided.Will he thrive as an independent artiste, or will he stumble under the weight of expectations? Only time will tell. Whatâ€™s clear is that heâ€™ll have to contend with a more cutthroat music business, where the stakes are higher, and the safety nets are fewer.What remains is the question: Will this be remembered as a savvy career move or a cautionary tale? Asake has the talent and momentum to make it work. But as history has shown, not all artistes who leave their labels at the height of their fame manage to sustain that success.For now, all eyes are on Asake. The road ahead will determine whether his decision to leave YBNL was a gamble worth taking or a misstep in an otherwise spectacular career. And for YBNL, itâ€™s back to the drawing boardâ€”because in the end, the music business waits for no one.Source:TrendyBeatz

https://www.nairaland.com/8343867/asake-leaves-ybnl-question-loyalty	EntPublisher001:TrendyBeatzanalyzes Asake's exit of YBNL!When whispers about Asake's departure from YBNL began circulating in December, it felt inevitable. The label that turned the young upcoming artiste from the streets of Lagos into a global Afrobeats phenomenon in just two years might be losing its prized asset. Born Ololade Ahmed,Asakehad spent a decade as an underground hustlerâ€”dabbling in dance, churning out music, and barely moving the needle. His fortunes changed in 2022, thanks to an introduction facilitated by his friend, Yhemo Lee, to the godfather of Nigerian street-pop, Olamide.Olamidedidnâ€™t just sign Asake; he threw the entire weight of YBNL behind him. From co-signs on tracks like Omo Ope to roping in Burna Boy for Sungba (Remix), Olamide went all in. The visionary business partnership between YBNL and Empire ensured Asake's music reached farther shores, making him a staple in UK and US Afrobeats circuits. Add TG Omoriâ€™s cinematic visualsâ€”eight in totalâ€”and you have the makings of an unstoppable cultural force. Asakeâ€™s journey seemed like a perfectly executed blueprint for success.But success has a way of complicating relationships. The signs were clear when Lungu Boy, his third project, dropped in 2024. Olamideâ€™s fingerprints were noticeably absentâ€”no guest verses, no songwriting credits. The project felt disconnected, starkly contrasting the laser-focused cohesion of Mr. Money With The Vibe and Work of Art. And when reports emerged that Olamide had offered an improved deal, only for Asake to decline and choose independence, the rupture felt complete.Is It Time to Fly Solo?From a legal standpoint, Asake has every right to leave YBNL if his contract has expired. It's a business arrangement with a beginning and an end. But morality? Thatâ€™s where things get murkier. YBNL gambled on Asake, poured resources into his career, and turned him into a global brand. For Asake to exit now, just as the label is poised to recoup its investments and enjoy the fruits of their labor, feels rather ungrateful.The Double Standards of SuccessItâ€™s hard to ignore the hypocrisy that often surrounds conversations like this. If Asakeâ€™s career had faltered, no one would bat an eye at his decision to leave YBNL. The narrative would likely shift to how YBNL didnâ€™t do enough to support him. Success, however, changes the stakes. Now, his departure is framed as betrayal, a refusal to honour the loyalty that brought him to the top. This isnâ€™t unique to Asake. Wizkidâ€™s departure from EME, Burna Boy leaving Aristokrat Records, and even Davido setting up his own DMW after a brief stint with HKNâ€”these stories all follow a similar arc. For Asake, the perception is different. Heâ€™s barely two years into his reign, and the decision to leave feels premature to some, calculated to others.A Gamble on IndependenceGoing independent is not for the faint-hearted. It requires a robust team, deep pockets, and a strategy that extends beyond the next hit single. Yes, Asake now has the visibility and financial muscle to chart his own course, but he also risks losing the structure and guidance that YBNL provided.Will he thrive as an independent artiste, or will he stumble under the weight of expectations? Only time will tell. Whatâ€™s clear is that heâ€™ll have to contend with a more cutthroat music business, where the stakes are higher, and the safety nets are fewer.What remains is the question: Will this be remembered as a savvy career move or a cautionary tale? Asake has the talent and momentum to make it work. But as history has shown, not all artistes who leave their labels at the height of their fame manage to sustain that success.For now, all eyes are on Asake. The road ahead will determine whether his decision to leave YBNL was a gamble worth taking or a misstep in an otherwise spectacular career. And for YBNL, itâ€™s back to the drawing boardâ€”because in the end, the music business waits for no one.Source:TrendyBeatzLife goes on.

https://www.nairaland.com/8343867/asake-leaves-ybnl-question-loyalty	Must Ashake die under YBNL?He signed a 2-year contract with YBNL. His contract is over and he has to move on with his own brand - Giran. Nothing wrong at all. He delivered well under YBNL.Even Olamide himself had to move on and started his YBNL brand. It's just life.No hatred nor betrayal anywhere unless y'all bloggers just want to start one. They are still cool.

https://www.nairaland.com/8343326/igp-expands-gender-based-violence-desk	The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun has approved the expansion of Gender-Based Violence (GBV) desk offices to all police divisions across Nigeria, ABN TV reports.This move is aimed at strengthening the fight against gender-based violence and ensuring easier access to justice for victims.Previously limited to zonal and state commands, the GBV desks will now be present at the divisional level, providing prompt and specialized attention to cases of violence against women, children, and other vulnerable individuals. The IGP has also directed the appointment of qualified officers as GBV desk officers in all divisions. These officers will undergo specialized training to enhance their ability to handle GBV cases professionally and sensitively.In addition to their role in addressing GBV cases, the newly appointed desk officers will oversee the Juvenile, Women, and Children (JWC) section in their respective divisions. This integration is expected to create a more comprehensive and victim-centered approach to handling cases of abuse and violence.The Nigeria Police Force has reiterated its commitment to protecting the rights of victims and ensuring swift justice delivery. The expansion of the GBV desk offices is seen as a proactive response to the increasing need for specialized interventions in addressing gender-based violence.Source:https://abntv.com.ng/news/igp-expands-gender-based-violence-desk-offices-to-all-police-divisions/

Violence isn't gender specific, women initiate violence against children that isn't theirs, women also initiate violence against men but somehow men aren't even in the equation of things.The last incident at Unizk, assuming it was a male student that assaulted a female lecturer, that student in addition to the expulsion will be prosecuted for aggravated assault in a court of competent jurisdiction but somehow its a woman no one is talking about prosecution to serve as deterrence to others who will want to repeat such stupid feats.Everyone matters, the men are also vulnerable like others

I used the word "bankrupt" loosely there.They aren't earning, infact they are losing money, so they can't run the club successfully.They can't spend out of their own pockets (the owners are Billionaires) due to FFP rules.So, they need to cut costs while trying to maximise earnings... That's why they sent those players out on loan, and won't be renewing contracts of Casemiro, Erikson and others.

He is a founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and highly regarded for his resourcefulness and brilliance.He served as governor of Kaduna State for eight years, and prior to elective office, he had served as Director-General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, and Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from 2003 to 2007.President Tinubu celebrates Mallam El-Rufai on this occasion and commends his endeavours for democracy; his meritorious service to the nation, and mentorship of the younger generation.The President acknowledges Mallam El-Rufai's role in the dialogues leading up to the formation of the APC and his contributions to the success of the party in the three consecutive elections of 2015, 2019, and 2023.President Tinubu wishes El-Rufai good health and strength for continuous service to the nation.https://x.com/NGRPresident/status/1891068751799280069?t=9T56xWlFLe9NCJSEjn-J2A&s=19

https://www.nairaland.com/8343699/contributed-victory-tinubu-celebrates-nasir	Jones4190:you means the same Kaduna that PDP won?Yes, same one. Going by your logic, it's safe to say that Sanwo-olu and even Tinubu are irrelevant and worked against themselves by supporting Obi, since they lost Lagos in a relatively free and fair election. They only managed to win the gubernatorial through voter suppression and by invoking tribal sentiments. Buhari, Ribadu, Ganduje et al lost their states to Atiku, but out of all these people, it's only Elrufai (his most vocal Northern champion) whom you guys accuse of working against Tinubu, just to provide justification for your betrayal.When are you guys going to admit that Tinubu was grossly unpopular in 2023 and now, even more so (he's been tested now and found lacking). He won with the least margin ever in Nigeria's political history. Despite all these, the numbers still show that the core North delivered Tinubu through the margins he got, at the time when even most Yorubas were too timid to openly support his campaign for fear of obidients (5.5m out of his 8.3m total was from the North.Tinubu does not even have the entire Southern base in his grip and could only salvage 4 out of 6 states in the Southwest, 1 state out of 6 in the Southsouth (Rivers state under questionable circumstances) and zero state in the Southeast. It wasnâ€™t the Northern minorities that made Tinubu president (they mostly voted Obi in protest of muslim-muslim ticket). It was the Northern majority (despite splitting their votes 3 ways between Tinubu, a very formidable Northern Atiku and to a lesser extent, Kwankwaso who still got over a million votes). Numbers don't lie.Tinubu would have been better off consolidating on his Northern base, not thinking he could replace the Northern majority with the minorities. To totally get the votes of Northern minorities, Tinubu will have to change his muslim-muslim ticket (suicide) or get CAN and all the pastors to endorse his muslim-muslim ticket (a set trap), all while improving on the economy.

https://www.nairaland.com/8343942/gov-adeleke-tinubu-nephew-oyetola	PRESS CONFERENCE BY HE, SENATOR ADEMOLA ADELEKE, EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF OSUN STATE.Gentlemen of the pressI called this press conference to alert the national and global audience about a deliberate plot to create chaos and anarchy in Osun state. I invite you all to expose a fascist anti-democratic agenda designed to enforce a non-existing court judgment on our local governments. This evil plot is being spearheaded by the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy,  Mr Gboyega Oyetola in active collaboration with the Osun state Commissioner of Police, the Osun state Director of DSS and the State Commandant of the Civil Defense Corps.Before I continue this address, let me affirm that I know Mr. President to be a true democrat, a lover of rule of law, and a believer in the sanctity of the judicial process. I know, as a matter of fact, that Mr. President will never authorise a dictatorial violation of the constitution irrespective of who is involved. It is crucial to add that Mr. President will never support any action that is capable of generating bloodbath and bloodshed.I, however, regret to inform Mr. President and the public that Mr Gboyega Oyetola has concluded an arrangement to cause mayhem in Osun state starting from Monday.He is issuing illegal directives to security operatives to enforce illegality simply because he is the nephew of Mr. President. I chose to alert the nation before my people are killed or maimed by a minister  dropping the name of Mr. President in connivance with the Osun state security operatives obeying unlawful orders.The bone of contention is the brazen effrontery to return to office council chairmen sacked  by a subsisting court Judgment using a different court decision, which has no consequential order.Let me make it clear that the said Council Chairmen were sacked before I was sworn in as governor of Osun State, contrary to the lies being peddled, that the Chairmen and councilors were sacked by my Executive Order.For emphasis, l want to state that I had nothing to do with the sacking of the chairmen and councilors produced by the Osun 2022 local government polls. The Chairmen and Councilors were sacked by two different judgments of the Federal High Court Osogbo.The script Mr Oyetola is playing is about the most reprehensible abuse of power in this fourth republic capable of untold and unforeseen consequences on the polity.The general public is aware that there were two different Federal  High Court judgments on the local government election of 2022. The first judgment was on the suit filed by the People Democratic Party (PDP) which sacked the product of the 2022 polls. The second judgment was on the suit filed by the Action People Party (APP), which also sacked the Chairmen and Councillors produced by the said 2022 Osun Local Government polls.The APC appeal against the judgment obtained by the PDP was partially successful, and the said judgment was struck out  based on the timing of filing, having been filed before the notice of election was published.It needs to be emphasized that the judgment contains no consequential orders.The APC in its amended notice of Appeal, asked the Court of Appeal to reinstate the sacked chairmen and councilors, but the Court of Appeal in its wisdom said it has become an academic exercise. The request for the reinstatement of the Chairmen and Councilors was not granted.However, the Appeal by the APC against the APP judgment did not succeed at the Court of Appeal, which makes the judgment still subsisting and alive.The Court of Appeal dismissed the APC appeal against the judgment obtained by the APP. The only legal recourse open to the APC is to appeal the APP judgment and the subsequent rulings of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.The Certified True Copies of both judgements had earlier been forwarded to the Osun state Commissioner of Police, the State Director of DSS and the state Commandant of Civil Defense by the Osun state Attorney General for their information and records.The Certified True Copies of  both judgments are in the public domain. The judgment of the Court of Appeal on the PDP case was not ambiguous whatsoever. It simply struck out the PDP suit and did not in any of its paragraphs order the reinstatement of the sacked council chairmen and Councilors.It is very clear that no consequential order was made because the APP case is still subsisting. As I stated earlier, the Court of Appeal said that the request for the reinstatement of the Chairmen and Councilors has become an academic exercise.We call on legal luminaries and the Nigerian Bar Association  to fact check our claims by reading and interpreting the judgments. Even a layman can comprehend the meaning except those with an agenda to destroy the peace and progress of Osun state.In a democratic society governed by the rule of  law, we all must submit to the law. If we are dissatisfied with the outcome of a court process, we can appeal to the next court to end at the Supreme Court. If you are not sure of the meaning and intent of a court judgment, the system expects you to apply for interpretation again through the court system.It is illegal, unconstitutional, and anti-democratic to take the law into your own hands. For a serving minister, the person of Mr Gboyega Oyetola to lead the charge to violate the constitution and foment violence over a judicial process is not only shameful but is sadism and treason taken too far.We have it on good authority that  Mr Gboyega Oyetola  has instructed the Osun state Commissioner of Police,  the state Director of the DSS and the state Commandant of civil defence corps to mobilise security operatives from within Osun to effect the non existent judgement by forcefully taking over the local governments on Monday.Mr Oyetola and the police boss have been holding a series of meetings on how to effect the illegal operations.We affirm that Mr Gboyega Oyetola has no constitutional authority to issue directives to the security agencies.The fact that Mr Oyetola is nephew of Mr. President does not confer any such authority on him.We see this as a gross betrayal  of trust reposed in the Osun state security officers by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.I want to state that the current nefarious activities of Mr Oyetola and bosses of Osun security agencies constitute grave incitement. These need to stop because we are  neither  interested in resorting to self-help nor in support of violence to resolve political matters.  As much as we are law-abiding people, we are fierce protectors of our rights, at night and by the day.I want to place on notice the Nigerian Public, and our friends in the diplomatic community and the lovers of democracy and rule of law that our people will not accept any attempt to impose illegality and anarchy on us.We will not allow any takeover of the local government except through a judicial pronouncement or a democratic process.We vehemently reject any ploy to deploy a non-existing court order to achieve local political power.I therefore appeal to  Mr President who is a renown democrat to insist on the rule of law by instructing the Inspector General of Police, the Director General of DSS, the Commandant General of the Civil Defense Corps not to obey an illegal  order from his nephew, Mr Gboyega Oyetola. The Osun State security chiefs should also be called to order.I call on Mr President, to instruct the National Security Adviser, and the Attorney General of the Federation, to personally verify the fact that the Court of Appeal judgement did not reinstate the sacked local government chairmen and councilors and the fact that, there is a subsisting judgement of Court that sacked the Chairmen and Councillors  produced by the 2022 local government polls.The Nigerian public should hold Mr Gboyega Oyetola and the Osun state security chiefs responsible for any breakdown of law and order in the state tomorrow, Monday, and beyond.It is unfortunate that the Osun state security chiefs are taking instructions from Mr Gboyega Oyetola just because he is the nephew of Mr. President.As much as we will do our best to maintain peace, we call on men and women of goodwill to intervene before it is too late.I thank you for listening

https://www.nairaland.com/8343952/lagos-marathon-take-it-back	Yesterday, Sowore posted a video showing a mild drama that occurred during the Lagos State 2025 Marathon between him and Sanwo-Oluâ€™s men. He shared the video on his X handle, formerly known as Twitter, with the caption:"How occupying a canopy after the Lagos Marathon 10k infuriated some rogue elements who assaulted our crew members and journalists, leading to unprovoked attacks, which led to the seizure of a camera belonging to one of our journalists. They insisted on viewing and deleting all the content because it caught them live attacking our crew in Lagos."However, Punch newspaper reported today that the Take It Back (TIB) Movement has condemned what it described as a â€œdisgraceful attackâ€ on its leader, Omoyele Sowore, and movement members during Saturdayâ€™s Access Bank Lagos City Marathon.According to a statement issued on Saturday by the Director-General of TIB Global, Sowore and his team participated in the 10km race but were met with violence and harassment at the finish line in Eko Atlantic.The statement alleged that thugs, reportedly â€œsponsored by the Lagos State Government,â€ assaulted Sowore and his team, including members of the press."After crossing the finish line, Sowore and his comrades returned to the tents provided for participants, where they sat to address the media, including a Daily Trust reporter who had followed them throughout the race," the statement read.The movement claimed that some individuals approached them, insisting that the space was designated for â€œgovernment dignitariesâ€ and that they should vacate the area.Sowore reportedly questioned this assertion, challenging why non-participants were given priority over those who had completed the race.A team member assured the coordinators that they would only be there temporarily while waiting for other team members, after which they left.TIB alleged that about 10 minutes later, a group of thugs launched an unprovoked attack on Sowore, his team, and members of the press."The media crew covering the event was not spared, as they were also harassed and assaulted," the statement alleged.According to TIB, the attackers targeted their equipment, forcibly seizing a camera belonging to a media crew member named Happiness."Her camera was forcefully taken in an attempt to delete footage of the attack," the group stated, adding that as of the time of the statement, the camera had not been returned.In response, TIB demanded immediate action from the Lagos State Government and marathon organizers."We demand the immediate return of the stolen camera and footage, as well as a public apology from the marathon organizers for their complicity in this politically motivated aggression," the statement read.TIB highlighted that Sowore has participated in at least four editions of the Lagos City Marathon and described the attack as an â€œaffront to the principles of sportsmanship.â€As of press time, neither the Lagos State Government nor the organizers of the marathon had responded to the allegations.Sowore was attacked in Lagos by thugs alongside crew members of his media outfit while participating in the marathon.The Access Bank Lagos City Marathon is one of Nigeriaâ€™s most prestigious road races, attracting elite athletes, casual runners, and government dignitaries.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_muxktYgdY?si=VHlJltQKinsVVHO-

https://www.nairaland.com/8343840/delta-monarch-bans-female-native	The Asagba of Asaba in Delta State, HRM Obi Prof. Epiphany Azinge SAN, has banned the activities of â€˜Eze-Nwanyiâ€™ (female native doctors/goddesses) and other unregulated traditional practitioners.The decision comes amid concerns that these groups are fueling criminal activities, including kidnappings and ritual-related crimes.The palace maintained it was a decisive move to curb rising crime in Asaba and its environs.The announcement follows reports linking native doctors and shrines in Asaba to the murder of an Anambra lawmaker, Justice Azuka, whose body was discovered on the Niger Bridge.The Asagba, addressing a press conference, expressed grave concern over the situation, stating, â€œAnything that happens on this land affects us more than anyone else.It is unacceptable that Asaba has become a hub for these nefarious activities. Consequently, we have decided to take proactive steps to restore peace and order.â€Ban on Female Native Doctors, Shrine RestrictionsThe monarch emphasised that many of these practitioners are not of Asaba origin and have taken over the land with criminal motives.â€œWe have banned the activities of Eze-Nwanyi, who are not of Asaba extraction and are unknown to us. Their activities, I dare say, are nefarious.â€œWith the recent revelations linking an Anambra lawmakerâ€™s murder to Asaba-based native doctors and shrines, it is clear that they are not just supporting â€˜Yahoo Yahooâ€™ fraudsters but are also involved in kidnappings. From today, they are banned,â€ he declared.Additionally, all native doctors operating in Asaba must now register and be regulated under the authority of the Otu-Ihaza, the legislative body of Asaba.The monarch also restricted visits to the Onishe shrine, citing desecration concerns. â€œThat place is being desecrated. People go there for all sorts of reasons. Henceforth, nobody, whether from Asaba or not, may visit the shrine without the approval of the Otu-Ihaza.â€Operation â€˜Know Your TenantsHighlighting the rapid and unmonitored influx of strangers into Asaba, the Asagba introduced Operation Know Your Tenants, mandating landlords to document and keep an inventory of their tenants.â€œWe do not even know who lives in Asaba anymore. Criminals see Asaba as a safe haven. We are now declaring Operation Know Your Tenants.â€œEvery landlord must have proper documentation of their tenants so that at any time, we can account for who resides where,â€ he added.The monarch urged property owners to cooperate, warning that security measures would be tightened to identify and expel criminal elements.Hotel SurveillanceFurther, the palace will deploy a special task force to hotels across Asaba to inspect guest records.â€œWe will be going round hotels to check their guest lists. The palace is already collaborating with security agencies to ensure that those using hotels for criminal hideouts are exposed,â€ he asserted.The Asagba reaffirmed his support for government efforts in tackling insecurity but stressed that traditional institutions must also take an active role in protecting their communities.â€œWe stand with the government at all times, but there comes a moment when we must be more proactive. Asaba must not become a breeding ground for crime,â€ he concluded.https://punchng.com/delta-monarch-bans-female-native-doctors-restricts-shrines-amid-crime-concerns/?

If Soludo could be putting fire under their yansh in Anambra, why won't the same be done in Delta where they are running to hide. In summary, the Asagba says he doesn't want development in his environment anymore. This is what you get when your only export value is criminality.

And however a person choose to worship their African religion should be respected;    But as long as the practitioners respect the general laws.
