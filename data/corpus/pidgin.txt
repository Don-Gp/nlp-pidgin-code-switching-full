Di last past five winners
Pep Guardiola and im Manchester City side avoid wetin for be ogbonge embarrassment as dem manage to beat Club Brugge 3-1 for dia last match for di league phase of dis year Uefa Champions League.
Guardiola boys manage only a disappointing 11 points wit only three wins and three draws for dia eight matches of di Champions League first round.
Meanwhile, Arne Slot and im Liverpool team finish on top of di league even though dem lose dia final match 3-2 against PSV Eindhoven for di Netherlands.
Arsenal also qualify automatically for di round of 16 after dem beat Girona 2-1 for Spain to finish third on di table.
Di same tin wit Aston Villa who beat Celtic 3-2 for Villa Park to occupy di last qualification position of eighth.
Altogether, three English teams, two Spanish, and one team each from Italy, Germany and France make am into di top eight wey be di automatic qualification position for di round of 16.
E shock many pipo say big names like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, Manchester City, and AC Milan no qualify automatically.
Below na how di league phase of di new Champions League format take
First, make we remind ourself of wetin di 36 league-phase teams dey aim for.
Those wey finish for di top eight go automatically progress to di last 16, wia dem go seed dem.
Those wey finish between ninth and 16th dem go seed dem and dem go face teams wey dey placed 17th to 24th, wit di advantage of playing di second leg at home.
Di clubs 25th or lower don chop elimination and dem no go get entry to di Europa League.
Di play-off ties go take place mid-February, while di last-16 matches go happun for di first two weeks of March.
One of Uefa reasons for changing to dis format na to make ""every game count"".
Dem say di format ""go ensure say any result get di potential to dramatically change a team position, right up to and including di very last matchday"".
And so, e don play out wit only two dead rubbers (Sturm Graz v Leipzig and Young Boys v Red Star Belgrade) and 16 games wit something on di line.
E get several games wia both clubs dey battle for di same goal, like Manchester City v Club Brugge, Stuttgart v PSG, Brest v Real Madrid and Inter Milan v Monaco.
E fit lead to enjoyable mayhem for fans wit some teams potentially wey go dey affected by more dan 10 oda games.
Aston Villa, for example, fit overtake six teams or 15 teams fit overtake dem (although not all 15) - including opponents Celtic.
Another reason Uefa give for the new format na to ensure more matches between di top teams in di initial stages of di tournament.
Dis year don see Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in repeats of three recent finals, and Barcelona play Bayern Munich, while Paris St-Germain don face Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.
Failing to qualify for di next round go hit teams financially.
Every club for di league phase go get 18.62m euros for participating, wit performance bonuses of 2.1m euros per win and 700,000 euros per draw.
So di team wey finish 36th earn dis much, 35th go claim 550,000 euros through to 9.9m euros for di table-toppers.
Teams wey finish first to eighth also go earn 2m euros bonus, while teams wey finish ninth to 16th go get 1m euros.
Uefa also introduce a ""value pillar"" wey go split di broadcast revenue.
Dis again go increase depending on your finishing position for di league phase.
Dat na bifor dem take into account matchday revenue and oda factors.
In oda words, e dey costly to chop elimination early."
Papa of di late Nigerian singer Ileroluwa Imole Aloba AKA.
Mohbad say na till authorities determine wetin kill im son, na im dem go bury am.
Dem bin bury am almost immediately but authorities later exhume di body to find out wetin kill am.

Witout di critical staff wey dey coordinate USAID activities, distributing medicines don become a challenge.
Even wia services technically dey permitted to resume, many contracts remain uncertain.
Health workers dey unsure of wetin dem fit and fit no do.
Di Trump administration plan to significantly reduce USAID staff by more dan 90%.
Atul Gawande, USAID former Global Health Assistant Administrator, post on X say di agency workforce go dey slashed from 14,000 to 294wit only 12 staff assigned to Africa.

""In di past year, USAID give $8 billion of aid assistance to Africa.
Seventy-three percent go to healthcare,"" Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya tell di BBC Newsday program on 29 January.

South Africa dey cova almost 80%.
But for many low-income nations, debt burdens, climate disasters, and economic shocks dey make self-sufficiency nearly impossible.

''Di first time I see my daughter face, I forget all my pregnancy pain,"" Kinjal Lathi, from Ahmedabad in India tok.
Until dat moment marriage and motherhood dey always feel like a distant dream for Kinjal becos she get beta thalassaemia major disease.
She need a blood transfusion evri two weeks and gatz follow a veri strict diet and medicine regime.
Added to her underlying health condition na di challenge to born a child in di first place and to carry am.
But I decide to realise my motherhood dream,'' Kinjal tok.
She get a planned caesarean section birth wey dey designed to minimise any potential blood loss.
Even afta she give birth, di 25 year-old ""gatz undergo blood transfusion,"" she tok.
She add say at one point she do transfusion and at di same time she dey breastfeed her newborn baby
Di blood disorder no dey inherited by her daughter.
Thalassaemia dey caused by faulty genes wey dey affect di production of haemoglobin wey be di protein for red blood cells wey dey carry oxygen around di body.
Pikin fit only dey born wit thalassaemia if dem inherit dis faulty genes from both parents.
So, if both parents get di faulty gene wey dey cause beta thalassaemia major, e get a one in four chance of each child say dem go dey born wit di condition.
Parents of a child wit thalassaemia na usually carriers, meaning say dem only get one of di faulty genes.
Kinjal successful pregnancy dey extremely rare, according to paediatrician Doctor Anil Khatri, member of di Gujarat State thalassaemia task force.
E treat both mother and child.
So rare, in fact, na somtin wey im neva previously encounter for di last three decades as a doctor treating more dan 100 thalassaemia patients.
Na devastating disease wey dey make patients weak, get short of breath, unable to work and cut dia life expectancy.
Some 10,000-15,000 Indian babies dey born wit di disease evri year.
To give birth to a baby in di first place dey harder for pipo wit thalassaemia, gynaecologist Doctor Uma Khatri, wey treat Kinjal, explain.
Repeated blood transfusions fit affect di hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenaline glands and secretion of hormones wey dey impact fertility.
Correctly balancing iron levels through transfusions also dey challenging and patients fit also end up wit too much iron circulating for dia blood.
During pregnancy, di volume of blood for your body increase and so also di amount of iron wey you need to support yourself and supply oxygen to your baby.
""Thalassaemia patients don increase iron due to repeated blood transfusions.
""Usually, we dey call pregnant women for a check-up once a month.
We dey call Kinjal evri 15 days.
Dis na first-time for us too,"" Khatri tok as she explain say sonography normally na monthly to monitor a baby growth during pregnancy.
Sake of di additional strain pregnancy fit put on Kinjal body, her husband Naveen Lathia dey understandably worried.
E say e dey ""afraid im go lose Kinjal for di process."" But following her insistence, despite di risks, she still wan get a baby so e begin to research.
E no dey able to find a single oda case of a woman wit thalassaemia major giving birth to a healthy child.
""But afta I discuss am wit di doctor, I dey ready,"" e tok.
Afta di birth, doctors advise Kinjal to stick to home-cooked food and stay away from crowded places to reduce any risk of infection.
Dr Khatri say TM patients dey at higher risk of infection as dia vital organs like heart, kidneys, lungs fit don damage and weaken dia immune response.

However, doctors advise say if couple wey dey expect pikin both get thalassemia minor, a prenatal test fit take place for utero - wen di foetus still dey for di mother womb - at eight to nine weeks old.
Marcus Rashford na one of di popular players for Premier League.
Im don make 426 appearances for Manchester United and im dey 12th for di club all-time scoring list wit 138 goals.
Di 27-year-old don win both di FA Cup and EFL Cup twice.
Im also don win di Europa League.
Im get 60 England caps.
Outside football, dem award am MBE for 2021 for im work around child poverty.
But now im career get as e be sake of tori wey dey fly up and down say im days for United dey numbered afta im coach drop am for di Manchester derby.
On 18 July 2023 United confam say Rashford don sign new contract wey go keep am for di club until 30 June 2028.
Dis end all di tok-tok about im future as Rashford previous deal bin dey due to expire in 12 months and im already don dey linked wit a number of major European clubs.
Rashford bin just score a career-best 30 domestic goals during di 2022-23 season and im still only be 25.
Afta three games witout a goal, im score di opener for wetin turn out to be a 3-1 defeat for Arsenal on 3 September.
Im no score again for anoda 13 games as United poor form under Erik ten Hag begin.
For January di coach drop Rashford for dia FA Cup trip to Newport County afta e miss training sake of illness afta im bin spend longer time pass wetin dem approve for am for one authorised trip to Belfast.
Foto comot of am wia im dey enter nightclub wia im bin drink tequila.
Although Rashford score di first goal of Ruben Amorim reign afta only 81 seconds for Ipswich on 24 November, di new United head coach don admit say di central striker no be di 27-year-old best position.
Although Rashford bin start three games and be substitute for three of Amorim first six games in charge.
But, crucially, im bin dey bench for di midweek Premier League trip to Arsenal and di home game wey follow against Nottingham Forest on 7 December.
Im start for di Europa League against Vitoria Plzen on 12 December but dem replace am afta 56 minutes wen United dey 1-0 down.
Dem go on to win 2-1.
Dem drop am along wit Alejandro Garnacho for di Manchester derby.
Afta di game, Amorim explain ""Di performance for training, di way you eat, di way you push your team-mates - evritin dey important for di beginning of somtin.
Wen pipo for your club dey lose dia jobs, we gatz put di standards really high.""
At some point, evri manager get to make big calls.
weda you like am or not, di outcome go end up to be how pipo see am .
Sir Alex Ferguson time for United dey littered wit major decisions - from axing Paul McGrath and Norman Whiteside but keeping Bryan Robson for di start of im reign, to letting Paul Pogba leave at di end.
Amorim know exactly wetin di fallout go be from im decision to leave Rashford out.
If United bin lose for Manchester City, pipo for ask many questions about di wisdom of just having only Joshua Zirkzee for bench as attacking player.
But dem no need to.
Thanks to Amad Diallo, dem win.
""Today we prove say we fit leave anybodi out and win,"" Amorim tok afterwards.
Dat na big stick to take beat im players.
Rashford na realist.
Im go know di hand writing for wall for am.
E dey fair to say for di past 18 months - or for all but di 2022-23 season since November 2021 im score only twice for im last 28 appearances of di campaign wey Ralf Rangnick end in charge - im form dey below di standards of wetin im dey capable of.
Many pipo don criticise am well-well for im work ethic - and by some for im off-field behaviour, wey include trip to United States during di November international break.
But dat side of im life no go change.
Im need to deliver - and many times, im no dey deliver.
Rashford na one of United highest earners, im basic wage reach 300,000 a week.
Only a small number of clubs fit afford dat salary and, for a variety of reasons, some of dem no dey market.
Real Madrid already struggle to find di right attacking combination from Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham.
Atletico bin pay big money to Manchester City for Julian Alvarez just bifor di summer transfer deadline.
For England top clubs, Manchester City and Liverpool na a bit of a stretch, even wit City poor form.
Arsenal need a central striker - and Rashford no like to play dia.
Tottenham dey inconsistent but e dey hardly likely for dem to drop dia skipper Son Heung-min, wey dey play for left.
Many times pipo don mention Paris St-Germain as a possible destination on a number of occasions down di years, but di French giants don always comot dia bodi from dat kain tok.
United don previously dey linked wit Randal Kolo Muani.
However, even a swap deal dey questionable sake of say Rasmus Hojlund don impress as Amorim first choice for di lead attacking role.
Di Saudi Pro League fit make a big statement by signing such a recognisable figure from di Premier League wey be 27years.
However, di feeling na say Rashford no buy dat kain plan.
A loan involving some kain wage contribution dey possible.
But United don repeatedly speak of dia tight profit and sustainability rules (PSR) situation, as well as dia commitment to abide by di rules, so paying to let a high earner play for someone else go dey counter-productive.
Anybodi wey dey old enough to remember di Wayne Rooney saga from October 2010, wen im drop in a transfer request, wey Ferguson publicly finish am.
Dis mata get three main points.
First one, na weda Rashford go meet Amorim demands?
Dat, really, go be di easy bit - certainly di effort suppose dey non-negotiable.
I dey tok about di effort Amorim dey demand, no be wetin di social media observers tink.
Second one, na if, im go fit di system?
Dis part dey a bit more tricky.
But no slot for dat for Amorim system.
Di coach don already tok say Rashford no dey ideally suited for a typical number nine role, wey go leave am wit either wing back (unlikely) or inside forward.
Di inside forward go require a lot of work, wey United no get wit dia current schedule.
But if Hojlund dey hold di ball up, using Rashford pace to run na a viable alternative.
If Amorim want im team to dominate possession, e dey less valuable, especially if dem dey move into a higher area for pitch on a more consistent basis.
Di third option na to accept make di team dey use am as impact substitute.
As Rashford dey approach di peak point of im career, going down dat route dey difficult to see am happun."
""Abeg help us,"" na di message wey dem write on piece of paper wey two girls hold up through di window of one room for di luxury Decpolis hotel for Panama City.
Di hotel offer dia clients rooms wit sea views, e get two exclusive restaurants, swimming pool, spa and private transportation.
But di hotel don become ""temporary custody"" centre wey dey house 299 migrants wey dem deport from di US, di Panamanian goment tok on Tuesday.
Odas hang small sign wit messages such ""We no dey safe in our kontri.""
Dis migrants, dey part of di undocumented pipo wey Trump administration deport from di US, dem arrive for Panama on three flights last week.
President Jos Ral Mulino recently agree say Panama go become di ""bridge"" kontri for deportees wey dem force to comot from US.
Howeva, di 299 migrants - from India, China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Vietnam, Turkey, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - only 171 don agree to return to dia kontris of origin.
Di remainder dey face more uncertain future.
According to di Panamanian goment, dem go transfer dis group to camp in di province of Darin, wey don temporarily house migrants wey dey cross di jungle to di US.
From di street, pipo dey hang di clothes wey dem wash for window.
One of di items na yellow Lakers basketball jersey wit di number 24, wey legendary player Kobe Bryant don wear.
For anoda window, one group of adults and three children don raise dia arms wit dia thumbs for dia palms - di international symbol for pipo wey need assistance.
""Help us,"" dem write am in red letters on di glass.
Two minors wey cover dia faces hold up sheets of paper against di glass wit di ""Abeg save di Afghan girls.""
One Iranian woman wey dey live for Panama for some years tell di BBC say she dey in contact wit one of di migrants wey dey inside di hotel and dem dey ""fear"" say dem fit return to Iran.
Using hidden mobile phone, since di contact wit pipo wey dey outside of di Decpolis hotel reportedly no dey allowed, di Iranian woman tok say migrant tell her say ""several minors dey trapped"" for di hotel, wey dem don deny lawyer and dem no allow dem to comot from dia rooms even to go chop.
Afta di media first report di story of di deportees on Tuesday, security measures put in place dey tight and dem don cut migrants access to di internet, di Iranian woman tok.
Howeva, di Minister of Public Security of Panama Frank brego tok say migrants no dey allowed to comot from di hotel say im goment must guarantee di safety and peace of di Panamanians.
Video wey dem post on social media on di weekend show one of di migrants wey describe for Farsi how dem detain dem afta dem cross di border to di US and tell dem say dem go take dem to Texas, but end up in Panama.
Di woman in di video insist say dia lives dey in danger if dem return to Iran becos of possible attack of di goment.
Her intention, she tok say, na to seek political asylum.
Analysts say dis go dey difficult to obtain witout access to lawyer - even more so wen di Panamanian goment don announce dem no go offer di access to deportees.
On Tuesday, brego say di migrants go remain temporarily for Panama unda di protection of di kontri authorities.
""Wetin we agree wit di US goment be say dem dey here and go remain for temporary custody for dia protection,"" e tok.
E also warn say pipo wey migrants wey no wish to return to dia kontri of origin go need to choose third kontri.
In dat case, e say, di International Organization for Migration (IOM) and di United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) go dey responsible for dia return.
brego tok say di migrants dey live for Decpolis hotel becos of im capacity to receive dem.
Anoda senior official tok say ""dem no dey expect di arrival of more migrants"" becos no more flights.
Panama don gree to be ""bridge"" kontri for deportations afta di visit of di US Secretary of State Marco Rubio to di kontri amid tensions ova Trump threats to ""recover"" sovereignty of di Panama Canal.
""While we no get direct involvement in di detention or restriction of movement of pipo, we dey committed to ensuring say dem dey treat all migrants wit respect and in accordance wit international standards,"" e tok.
Muzaffar Chishti, senior researcher for di Migration Policy Institute - think tank in di US - tok say many of di deportees dey come from nations wey no dey open to accepting di return of nationals wey dem deport from di US.
""By sending dem to Panama, di US no dey for di foto,"" e tok.
""Na headache for Panama to take charge of di negotiations and see how dis kontri go agree to take dem again.""
Dis week, flight wey dey carry deportees from di US go arrive for Costa Rica, anoda Central American kontri wey don agree wit Washington to become ""bridge"" on di path of migrants on uncertain journey.

Di risk factors "
Di mineral-rich east of di Democratic Republic of Congo don dey affected by conflict for more dan 30 years, since di 1994 Rwandan genocide.
Plenty armed groups don compete wit di central authorities to gain power and control of di potential fortune for dis vast nation.
Afta one rapid advance for di region, fighters from di M23 rebel group don take control of most part of Goma  one major city of more dan one million pipo for di east of DR Congo.
Goma, wey lie for di foot of one volcano near Lake Kivu, dey share border wit Rwanda.
Goma na di capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and na important trading and transport hub wey dey close to mining towns wey dey supply metals and minerals in high demand like gold, tin and coltan, wey be key component of mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.
Goma also na di base for di UN largest peacekeeping mission.
Di rebels tok say dem dey control di city, although reports dey say dem still dey face small-small resistance.
UN aid agencies don warn of major humanitarian crisis, as casualties don full hospitals and bodies lie down for streets.
Ethnic Tutsis na dem dey lead di M23.
Dem say dem need arms to protect di minority group.
Shortly afta dia creation for 2012, di M23 bin rapidly gain territory and seize Goma  actions wey receive international condemnations and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.
Dem force dem to withdraw from Goma, and dem suffer series of heavy defeats for di hands of di Congolese army plus one UN force wey ensure say dem force dem comot di kontri.
M23 fighters later agreed join di army but wit promises say Tutsis go dey protected.
But for 2021, di group bin take up arms again, as dem say goment break and no honour di promises.
Neighbouring Rwanda in di past don consistently deny say dem dey support M23, but for 2012, UN experts bin accuse Rwanda of providing weapons, logistical support and say na dem even dey command di rebels.
DR Congo goment, di US and France, don also identify say Rwanda dey back di group.
Last year, one UN experts report tok say up to 4,000 Rwandan troops dey fight alongside di M23.
For inside one statement on Sunday, Rwanda no openly deny say dem dey back M23, but instead dem say di fighting wey dey near dia border na ""serious threat"" to dia ""security and territorial integrity"".
Rwanda add say pipo dey use di kontri as scapegoat as dem blame di recent fighting on di Congolese authorities, dem say di authorities don refuse to dialogue wit di M23.
Dem fit partly trace di origin of di current fighting back to di genocide for Rwanda for 1994.
Ethnic Hutu extremists bin kill about 800,000 pipo majority of dem from di Tutsi community.
Fearing retaliations, an estimate of about one million Hutus bin run across di border to wetin now be DR Congo.
Dis fuel ethnic tensions as one marginalised Tutsi group for di east  di Banyamulenge  bin feel increasingly under threat.
Rwanda army invade DR Congo two times, dem tok say dem dey go afta some of those wey dey responsible for di genocide.
Dem work wit members of di Banyamulenge plus oda armed groups.
Afta 30 years of conflict, one of di Hutu groups, di Democratic Forces for di Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), wey include some of those wey dey responsible for di Rwandan genocide, still dey active for eastern DR Congo.
Rwanda describe di FDLR as ""genocidal militia"" and dem say dia continued existence for DR Congo east na threat to dia own territory.
Dem accuse di Congolese authorities of working wit di FDLR  accuse wey DR Congo deny.
Rwanda no go stay out of DR Congo unless dem dey very sure say FDLR no be threat to dia kontri again, or to di Tutsi communities for eastern DR Congo.
DR Congo and multiple UN reports don accuse Rwanda say dem dey use di conflict as way to loot Congolese minerals, like gold and coltan.
In recent years, di M23 don seize several lucrative mining areas and one report by UN experts last December tok say, M23 dey send around 120 tonnes of coltan to Rwanda every four weeks.
Dem also note huge rise for Rwanda mineral exports in recent years, most of which dem believe come from DR Congo.
Rwanda consistently don deny allegations say dem dey exploit DR Congo minerals.
One UN peacekeeping mission don dey in place since 1999.
Di current force  known as Monusco  dey made up of more dan 10,000 troops.
However, out of these, na only di Force Intervention Brigade dey allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups.
Na dis force help defeat M23 for 2013.
President Flix Tshisekedi, wey reason di mission as a failure, bin ask dem to leave by di end of last year.
But dem no go for December and dem extend di mission for anoda one year.
Di Southern African Development Community (Sadc), one regional grouping of 16 kontris don also send one military force to eastern DR Congo, but dem still no fit stop di rebels.
South Africa tok say 13 of dia sojas don die for di clashes wit rebels as dem dey try stop di advance on Goma.
Three Malawian sojas also don die.
UN tok say Uruguay also lost one of dia sojas wey be part of di Monusco force.
Congolese President Flix Tshisekedi don vow to restore goment authority for di east, where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels don seize most part of di city of Goma and dey reportedly advance south to seize more territory.
For one televised address to di nation, e say ""vigorous and coordinated response"" against wetin e call ""terrorists"" dey under way.
E condemn di international community for ""inaction"" and say dem no do enough in di wake of di escalating security crisis.
Di weeks-long offensive by di rebels don prompt warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis and growing international pressure to end di crisis.
During Wednesday night address, Tshisekedi bin ask all Congolese to join together and support di army fight to retake control.
""Be sure of one di Democratic Republic of Congo no go allow itself to dey humiliated or crushed.
Di fighting don force about 500,000 pipo to run comot dia homes, and e don worsen di already serious humanitarian crisis for di kontri, according to di UN.
Since di fighting start, electricity no dey di city again, water and food also dey very scarce.

Egyptologists don discover di first tomb of a pharaoh since dem uncover Tutankhamun own over a century ago.
King Thutmose II tomb na di last undiscovered royal tomb of di 18th Egyptian dynasty.
A British-Egyptian team locate am for di Western Valleys of di Theban Necropolis near di city of Luxor.
Researchers bin tink say di burial chambers of di 18th dynasty pharaohs bin dey more dan 2km away, closer to di Valley of di Kings.
Di crew find am for area wey dey associated with di resting places of royal women, but wen dem enta inside di burial chamber, dem say e dey decorated - with di sign of pharaoh.
""Part of di ceiling bin still dey a blue-painted ceiling with yellow stars on am.
And blue-painted ceilings with yellow stars, na for kings' tombs dem dey find am,"" na so di field director of di mission Dr Piers Litherland tok.
E tell BBC Newshour programme say im bin feel overwhelmed in di moment.
""Di emotion of getting into dis tins na just one of extraordinary confusion becos wen you come across something wey you no expect to find, e dey emotional really,"" e tok.
""And wen I come out, my wife bin dey wait outside and di only thing I fit do na to burst into tears.""
Dr Litherland say di discovery don solve di mystery of wia di tombs of early 18th dynasty kings dey located.
Researchers find Thutmose II mummified remains two centuries ago but di original burial site bin never dey located.
Thutmose II na ancestor of Tutankhamun, wey im reign dey believed to dey from about 1493 to 1479 BC.
Thutmose II dey best known for being di husband of Queen Hatshepsut, regarded as one of Egypt greatest pharaohs and one of di few female pharaohs wey rule in her own right.
Dr Litherland say di ""large staircase and a very large descending corridor"" of di tomb suggest grandeur.
""E take us a very long time to get through all dat,"" e tok, noting say e bin dey blocked by flood, dirty and di ceilings bin don collapse.
""Na only after we crawl through 10m (32ft) passageway wey get small 40cm gap at di top na im we get into di burial chamber.""
Na dia dem discover di blue ceiling and decorations of scenes from di Amduat, religious text wey dey reserved for kings.
Dat na anoda key sign say dem don find a king tomb, Dr Litherland tok.
Dem set to work clearing di dirty dem - expecting say dem go find di crushed remains of a burial underneath.
But ""di tomb turn out to dey completely empty"", Dr Litherland tok.
Dem come work out say di tomb bin don dey flooded bifor - ""dem bin build am underneath waterfall"" - just a few years after di king burial and move di contents to anoda location in ancient times.
Na through going through tonnes of limestone for di chamber na im dem find parts of alabaster jars, wey dem write di names of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut.
Dis pieces of alabaster ""bin probably dey broken wen dem bin dey move di tomb,"" Dr Litherland tok.
""And thank goodness say dem actually break one or two things becos dat na how we find out who get di tomb.""
Di artefacts na di first objects wey dem find wey dey associated with Thutmose II burial.
Dr Litherland say im team get a rough idea of wia di second tomb dey, and e fit still dey intact with treasures.
Di discovery of di pharaoh tomb cap off more dan 12 years of work by di joint team from Dr Litherland New Kingdom Research Foundation and Egypt Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.
Di team bin don previously excavate 54 tombs for di western part of di Theban mountain in Luxor, and bin also establish di identities of more dan 30 royal wives and court women.
""Dis na di first royal tomb to dey discovered since di ground-breaking find of King Tutankhamun burial chamber for 1922,"" na so Egypt minister of tourism and antiquities Sherif Fathy tok.
""Dis na extraordinary moment for Egyptology and di broader understanding of our shared human story."""
Wen I first drive into DR Congo eastern city of Goma, e hard me to tell weda I don enter a conflict zone.
But e only take a few minutes to notice say a new ""goment"" dey town.
As I reach one checkpoint near a police post wey bin dey formerly run by di Congolese authorities, fighters wey carry gun from di M23 rebel group stop my car.
Last week, M23 bin capture Goma, eastern city of nearly two million pipo, after dem advance on DR Congo eastern region.
At least 700 pipo for di city dey killed and close to 3,000 injured as di rebels clash with DR Congo army and dia allies, according to di UN and di Congolese goment.
M23, wey dey made up of ethnic Tutsis, say dem dey fight for minority rights, while DR Congo goment say di Rwanda-backed rebels dey seek control of di eastern region vast mineral wealth.
For di checkpoint, M23 rebels look inside my car, ask my driver a few brief questions, den allow us to pass into di devastated city.
Di rebels no face opposition - e be like say dem always dey dia.
I make my way to one of di few hospitals wey dey treat wounded victims and as I enter, cries of pain dey echo through di corridors.
I meet Nathaniel Cirho, one medical doctor wey, in a strange role reversal, sidon for one hospital bed with a sling around im left arm.
One 65-year-old man get injury for im belle.
After surgery, e no survive,"" e tok with regret.
She bin comot bullet from her own arm after heavy exchange of fire break out for her neighbourhood.
""Suddenly my hand feel cold, and I realise say dem don shoot me,"" she tok as she struggle to find her speech.
For days, she nurse di gunshot wound without help.
She tell me say some M23 fighters eventually escort her to a public hospital.
Di woman ask make dem move her to a private hospital, wia she dey receive treatment, becos she bin no dey receive adequate attention from di overstretched doctors.
But even for dis second hospital, medics dey overwhelmed as an increasing number of patients dey come through di doors.
""We don treat most of dem becos we no get contingency plans,"" one doctor, wey no want call im name for security reasons tok.
E add ""On Sunday wen di fighting start, we receive 315 patients and we treat dem.""
But now, di hospital dey count over 700 patients with various degrees of injury, di doctor tell me.
E tok of receiving patients with ""gunshot wounds to di head, odas on di chest, stomach, hands and legs"".
As eastern DR Congo dey inside dia political palava, di UN Office of di High Commissioner for Human Rights don warn say rival parties dey use sexual violence as a weapon of war.
Di doctor for dis private hospital confam di UN statement, say im facility so far don receive about 10 victims of rape and gender-based violence.
Outside di hospital and into di city centre, di feelings dey mixed.
Some shops don open for some streets, but not for odas.
Perhaps some dey careful say anytin fit happen with di way di security situation for di wider North Kivu province dey.
""Pipo dey fear...
I still dey fear becos those wey cause di tension still dey with us and we no know wetin dey go on,"" shop owner Sammy Matabishi tok.
""But di bad tin be say pipo no dey buy from us, many don go Rwanda, [di Congolese city of] Bukavu, Kenya and Uganda.""
Many residents I tok to say dem don come to terms with M23 running di place.
And as an outsider I fit see say di rebels wan establish dia control.
Dem don take over di office of di North Kivu military governor, wey dem kill as dem advance into Goma.
Fighters bin also dey present for strategic areas around di city, while odas dey patrol di streets on pickup trucks, with weapons for dia hand.
During di whole time I dey Goma, I no see a single active Congolese soldier.
I however, see abandoned trucks with ""FARDC"", di French acronym for di DRC armed forces.
Near di base of di UN peacekeeping mission (Monusco) - wey get di task of protecting civilians from rebel forces - military uniforms, magazines and bullets just dey anyhow across di road.
""Wen M23 arrive here, dem surround our army,"" Richard Ali wey dey live nearby, tell me.
""Many remove dia military uniforms, troway dia weapons and wear civilian clothes.
Odas run away.""
As M23 dey rejoice over a major win, di Congolese goment continue to deny di rebels claim say dem don totally capture Goma.
Di authorities accuse M23 of illegally occupying dia land - with di support of Rwanda - and promise to recover any lost territory.
Di rebels now dey reported to dey move south towards Bukavu, di capital of South Kivu, and dem vow to reach capital city Kinshasa.
Conditions dia show wetin life fit become for many more Congolese pipo, if di M23 gain more ground.

Many Nigerians surprise afta di National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) release di inflation figure for January 2025, wey show say inflation drop to 24.48% from di 34.4%.
Bifor dis latest figures, di inflation rate for Nigeria bin drop only once in 2024 and dat na for di month of July wen e drop from 34.19% to 33.4%; and e start to increase steadily again until di end of di year.
Dat na why di recent January figures by di NBS wey show a drastic drop of about 10%, take many pipo by surprise.
According to di NBS, dis development na sake of di rebasing wey dem do for di Consumer Price Index (CPI) wey be di main tool for measuring inflation.
""Di CPI be like basket and many goods and service wey Nigerians dey purchase on daily basis full inside.
Rebasing di CPI means say we dey swap out di outdated items for dis basket and we dey fill am wit oda newer items wey reflect wetin pipo dey buy today, and e go make sure say our inflation calculations dey more accurate,"" di NBS tok.
Dem further explain say dis new CPI basket include 960 products, up from di 740 products wey bin dey di old basket.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) na index wey dey give a general measure of changes in di average prices of goods and services wey consumers dey mostly buy compared to a period of time wey dem dey call di base year or price reference period.
One of di key importance of dis CPI na say dem dey use am produce kontri inflation rate among oda tins.
(i.e di current consumption pattern).
E go ensure say di inflation figure reflect current inflationary pressure and consumption patterns.
Di simple answer na no.
Na statistical process wey no directly get impact on di price of goods and service.
E dey only provide up to date measure of price change for di kontri.
Paul Alaje wey be ogbonge economist tok say di concept of rebasing mean say di NBS change di reference year wey dem bin dey use to calculate inflation.
Bifor now, di reference year wey di NBS bin dey use na 2009 but now dem decide to use 2024 as di reference or base year, Alaje explain for one interview wit Channels TV.
E further explain dat changing di reference year na best practice bicos two key decisions wey goment take recently - floating di naira and stopping fuel subsidy - bin get strong impact on di economy, so e no make sense to continue to dey use 2009 as di base year.
""Di only positive I fit give to dis, however, na di confidence wey dis new figures go bring to our economy in attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).
Anoda sabi pesin wey chook mouth for di matter, Uche Uwaleke, a professor of capital market for Nasarawa State University, agree say dis recent figures no exactly mean say prices of food or oda commodities don come down well-well, e go fit boost Nigeria ability to attract investors.
""Inflation na one number wey investors dey always look at bicos dem dey interested in di real rate of return on dia investment.
So wen di inflation number reflect more accurately di inflationary pressure, e go put investors in a position to make a favourable decision,"" oga Uwaleke tok.
E add say im dey expect dis new inflation rate to also affect di decision of di Central Bank of Nigeria wen dem meet to discuss interest rates.
Meanwhile, one X user wey im handle na @ThaMVP ""E no be must say we go adopt methodology wey reflect international best practices but e no reflect di peculiarity of local events.""
Anoda person, Maurice Ekpenyong, tok say ""food inflation dey more dan 100% and you want us to believe say e don drop to 26.08%?""
@alabioloyde simply ""Dis (figures) no dey correct and e no get any way wey dis na di reality""."

Charity Muturi don dey fight suicidal thoughts since she dey 14 years.
For her 30s, di Kenyan bin dey diagnosed wit bi-polar disorder.
Becos she sabi di kain shame and isolation wey conditions like di one wey she get dey cause, Charity bin work taya to carry di issue enta di goment eye to make sure say pipo wey dey in distress dey met wit care and not punishment.
Pipo wey sabi Charity call am say she dey selfless and unwavering, wey always dey give her time to help odas.
Her younger brother say ""like her name Charity, she bin dey full of love, very sacrificial and selfless"".
But her campaign to change how pipo dey see mental health for Kenya still dey on.
Mental health campaigners say Charity work bin dey important to change di law around suicide for di kontri.
For January dis year, Kenya High Court declare Section 226 of di Penal Code wey make suicide crime, say e dey unconstitutional.
Bifor anybodi wey try to kpai demselves fit face two years for prison or fine or both.
Pipo wey attempt suicide bin dey often arrested and prosecuted instead of dem to get mental health support.
January ruling wey Judge Lawrence Mugambi give find say di law wey punish pipo wit mental health issues dey go against dia right to healthcare.
Psychologist and mental health advocate Amisa Rashid, wey work togeda wit Charity say di ruling na victory for Kenyans and honour Charity work to make am come true.
She say, ""na very painful moment to pipo wey sabi am, dis go be her legacy"".
But Rashid say di struggle to bring wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues still dey go on.
She say, ""sometins dey wey we need to change wey include di societal, behavioural and attitude chage about suicide.,""
However, Rashid say di struggle to bring about wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues kontinue.
Di criminalization of attempted suicide get complex history.
For colonial times, many African colonies bin get law against suicide and even though many kontris don comot di laws, some don keep am afta independence.
For Ghana wia dem decriminalise suicide for 2023, mental health sabi pipo report say early signs of improved public look even though di deep-seated cultural beliefs still be challenge.
Dr Akwasi Osei, wey be di former chief executive of di Mental Health Authority of Ghana, tell di BBC say e fit dey ""too early to get documented evidence"" of complete change in attitudes about suicide mata, but e clear sat di move don lead to ""improved perception about suicide and attempted suicide"" for id kontri.
For Kenya, mental health professionals hope say di ruling go encourage pipo to find help witout fear say dem go face prosecution.
But many pipo still believe say di stigma wey surround suicide go continue until more efforts dey made to educate di public.
Dr Chido Madzvamutse, wey be mental health medical officer for di World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office say, ""decriminalization na step but we gatz move on to more open honest tok-tok about mental health generally.
Region and culture look am as immorality instead of health issue wey mean say di affected families no fit mourn come outside.
For Kenya, e no dey uncommon say di familes go hide wetin cause di death bicos of fear of stigma.
For some communities, dem no dey do traditional burial for pipo wey die by suicide and even di families fit face discrimination and isolation.
Dis cultural barriers dey make am hard for pipo to find support even wit di change of laws.
Religious leaders for many African kontris still dey against suicide attempts.
Archbishop Peter Ogunmuyiwa, wey be senior official for di Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)  one of di kontri largest religious groups say, only God get rght to take life for offence.
E say, ""one of di strong laws for Bible be thou shall not kill.
Na abomination bifor God, sin wey no get any forgiveness at all especially wen dem do am on purpose.""
But Archbishop Ogunmuyiwa say exception fit dey made for clinically certified individuals wit confam mental illness.
Sheikh Ibrahim Lithome, wey be Kenyan Muslim scholar and di legal and religious advisor to di Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims say suicide no dey allowed for di Islamic faith.
E say, ""Life na Allah own and no one get right to destroy.
No worldly punishment but ogbonge punishment dey for di afta life.
E add say dem need ask for forgiveness.
E say di survivors need support not punishment, say dem need counselling and spiritual guidance so dem go fit find hope.
Dat kain word fit also isolate pipo wey get mental illness.
She say to change di local language for mental health fit help ginger empathy and understanding.
Ghana experience fit give ogbonge lesson to Kenya move.
Since dem decriminalize suicide, Ghana don launch national awareness campaigns and improve mental health services to encourage pipo to find help.
But di kontri still dey face limited mental health infrastructure and deeply held social stigma.
For Nigeria wia suicide still be criminal offence, advocacy dey work wit goment to change di law.
One National Taskforce on Decriminalization of Suicide bin dey launched for 2024 to fit submit bill give parliament within di year.
Sabi pipo for Nigeria say Kenya court ruling fit be inspiration for dat kain tin to happun for dia kontri.
Cheluchi Onyemelukwe, wey be chair of Nigeria taskforce say, ""dem give us one year, we don dey work based on our terms of reference.
We dey hope say within dis year, dis kain tin go happun for us.""
Even though di ruling from Kenya High Court na ogbonge move, di kontri parliament gatz take action ot formally comot di law.
Mental health advocates want sharp-sharp legislative action to make sure say di ruling cause real policy change.
Di International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) dey work wit Kenyan partners to push for more reforms.
She say, ""Awareness for first responders; police, judiciary, community leaders and health care workers so dem go fit support pipo wit empathy and compassion.
Media also get important role to how dem dey tok about suicides for news to support di shift for attitude.""
For advocates like Amisa Rashid, di memory of Charity Muturi na reminder of how continued advocacy dey important.
We need dat spirit to stay alive and make sure say pipo wey get mental health issues dey di front of policy tok-tok"".

Ruto also call M23 make dem stop dia progress and make Kinshasa stop im revenge attacks.
Immediate ceasefire na di only way wey we go fit create necessary conditions for tk tok wey go give way forward and implementation of comprehensive peace agreement""
According to Ruto, DRC palava e complex, delicate, don too tey, and involve plenty actors wey dey pursue different interests.
DR Congo wahala no no be today e start, and no be mata wey concern only di kontri, e don dey go on for many many years.
Ruto say e get ""one kain underground international dimension, wey dem no fit to ignore im determination, doubtful and destructive effects any longer.
Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan wey host di regional summit say make regional leaders try find solutions to di conflict, beacos im dem fail, history go judge dem harshly.
""As regional leaders, history go judge us harshly if we sidon dey look di situation dey get worse day by day.
Currently, two different peace negotiations naim dey go on, one for Luanda capital of Angola and Nairobi, capital of Kenya but di summit say dem want make di combine di two togeda to become one Nairobi-Luanda process, so di two go fit complement each oda.
DR Congo big no be small.
Di kontri wey be two-thirds di size of Western Europe get long history of outside interference.
So, who be di main players and wetin dey want?
Congolese President Flix Tshisekedi wan regain di territory wey im kontri lost to di rebels, including di largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent dem from seizing more.
Im dey blame Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing M23 wit weapons and troops, wit di aim of stealing di kontri mineral wealth and to change regime.
Im claim say Rwanda dey support M23 rebels na base on evidence inside one UN report wey many African and Western goments believe.
But to Tshisikedi frustration, notin don happun.
Di Congolese leader dey also worry about keeping im seat.
""I tink di political survival of im goment dey at stake,"" Jason Stearns, one former UN investigator for DR Congo and current professor for Simon Fraser University, tok.
Rwanda long-time leader Kagame dey di centre of dis conflict, but im sabi dodge.
E also get long history of military intervention inside DR Congo wey get connection to di result of di 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Rwanda no gree say e dey provide military support to M23, but dey always tok say e go do anything necessary to defend imsef.
Kagame insist say Rwanda priority na to destroy one armed group wey Hutu genocide perpetrators, wey massacre Rwanda Tutsis, come run go wia now be eastern DR Congo.
E accuse DR Congo army of joining forces wit dem and odas not just to slaughter Congolese Tutsis - wey M23 claim say dem dey fight to protect - but to threaten Rwanda.
For diplomatic level, Rwanda want confirmation of im tori say di fight na Congolese problem, and Kigali just dey defend im borders against spill-over of di civil war.
Rwanda want make Kinshasa negotiate directly wit M23, Kinshasa refuse.
But wetin Rwanda really want according to Oga Stearns, na ""to maintain influence for eastern DR Congo"".
Kigali deny UN evidence say e dey smuggle plenty gold and oda metals out of eastern DR Congo and sell dem as im own.
But access to DR Congo mineral wealth n aim di koko of conflict for many years.
Rwanda dey see Burundi army as anoda security threat for eastern DR Congo.
Di kontri wey get borders wit both Rwanda and DR Congo don get thousands of soldiers dia for years.
Dem bin to hunt Burundi rebels but now dem dey support Kinshasa army to fight M23.
Relationship between Rwanda and Burundi dey hostile.
Di two kontris get similar tribes, but unlike Rwanda, di majority Hutus na dem dey rule for Burundi.
Di two kontris don dey accuse each oda of trying to overthrow each oda goment.
Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye bin post very strongly-worded warning on social media.
""If Rwanda continue to make conquests,"" im wrote, ""I know say war go even arrive Burundi...
One day im [Kagame] go wan come to Burundi  we no go accept dat.
Di war go spread.""
Dis threat go continue if M23 continue im takeover from Goma enta province of South Kivu closer to Burundi border, wey be wia dem station dia force.
Stearns say, ""Burundi dey worry say, if Rwandan troops...
Some dey fear di two wars wey bin occur for di region for late 1990s, fit repeat imsef.
Dat war bin drag nine different kontris follow body and bin reportedly led to millions of deaths.
Uganda no dey directly involved, but imsef get troops for eastern DR Congo.
Dem dey help Congolese goment with anoda different security threat  hunting down militants wey from Uganda wey dey connected to Islamic State group.
But Uganda role dey confusing  e dey work wit di Congolese, while at di same time, e dey allegedly provide at least complicit support to M23.
UN experts dey report say dis dey allow dem to use Uganda territory as a back base and supply route.
Kampala strongly deny am.
But e don respond to M23 offensive by putting im troops in ""forward defensive posture,"" to prevent oda armed groups from exploiting di crisis, e say.
Area pipo for di conflict area don report say dem dey see Uganda soldiers dey move enta di conflict zone.
But e dey also face accuse say e dey steal DR Congo natural resources, especially gold.
Analysts expect am to protect im economic interests even as e dey watch di Rwandans.
""E dey very clear say Uganda wan retain im own influence for eastern DR Congo and so dat im rival for Rwanda no g push am out,"" ICG Oga Moncrieff, tok.
South Africa contribute most of di sojas to one Southern African regional force wey dey fight alongside di Congolese army and don suffer heavy losses.
But dem also make headlines sake of one hurtful exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg.
South Africans bin blame di deaths of 14 of sojas on Rwandan Defense Forces, wey President Cyril Ramaphosa refer to as ""RDF militia.""
Im defence minister claim say im bin warn Kagame say dem go take any more shooting as declaration of war.
Dis tok vex Rwandan president, wey tok say di account of dia conversation na ""lie"" and e call South Africans ""aggressive"" force wey must leave DR Congo."

Di Ghana health service don begin to vaccinate pipo against cholera for di kontri afta ova 50 pipo die.
So far at least five out of di 16 regions of Ghana don confam cases of cholera as hospitals dey struggle to deal wit di outbreak.
Many oda pipio don dey on admission.
Data from di health service and ministry of health don show say di greater Accra, Eastern, Central, Ashanti and Western regions na di regions wey don record cases.
Dr Denis Laryea wey be oga in charge of disease surveillance don tok say ""pipo bin dey die sake of many pipo wey get di disease try to self-medicate, and odas bin dey report to di hospital three to four days afta di infection.
Na so dem begin to vaccinate pipo for di Greater Accra region between 14 -17 February 2025 as na di region wit di most cases - more dan 200 out of di 6,000 cases across di kontri.
Di Western and Central regions also get plenty cases.
For three days, di Ghana health service say dem dey target 300,000 pipo for dis vaccination for Accra.
Di areas for dis vaccination na di Ablekuma south, Okaikwei south and Ashiedu Keteke, all for di Greater Accra region.
Di health service say di oral cholera vaccine (OCV) na for evribodi wey be one year and above.
Dem also tok say di vaccine dey safe and effective
""Make una look for your area for di vaccination team, and take di vaccine to protect yoursef,"" di health service tok.
Kontri director for di World Health Organisation tok say cholera na, ""Highly contagious illness wey be global health threat.
For dis round of vaccination, di GHS say dem go do house-to-house and target districts wey be hotspots.
Dem tok say to know say di sickness una dey see na cholera, di patient go
- diarrhoea (wen pipo go dey poopoo water water).
- Patients go dey thirsty, tired and weak.
- Loss of body fluids wey fit lead to death.
Cholera dey spread by flies, water and food.
E dey transfer from faecal matter to pesin mouth.
If pesin drink water and food wey contaminate, im fit get cholera.
According to di health
- Pipo gatz drink clean water.
- Eat food wey hot.
- Make pipo stop open defecation.
- If pesin get acute diarrhoea dem gatz drink ORS quick and visit di hospital
- Pipo wey dey sell food gatz wash plates, cups, and oda tins well well."
For places like Iran, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and South Korea, di number of pipo in couples dey fall.
And survey data from Finland suggests say cohabiting couples dey more likely to break up dan dem fit start a family.
So why pipo for so many places dey struggle to form a lasting relationship?
Felipe, wey be 36 years old and dey live for Santa Catarina for Brazil say e neva get relationship despite say e dey try evritin wey e fit do to find partner.
For school, e dey write love letters to girls wey e get a crush on but di response no dey encouraging.
While e dey university e offer to help girls wit dia course work hoping say dem go spend more time wit am.
Den for im 30s e go for therapy to figure out how to connect wit women.
But tins neva work out so far.
Felipe dey work as a copywriter and spend most of im 20s witout stable job.
E believe say dis dey hurt im chances to impress women.
""But no be somtin wey just dey happun to me,"" e tok and add say many oda men dey feel lost and opting out of dating.
US data suggest say 18 to 24 years old, especially men, spend more time alone dan any oda group.
Dis na sharp opposite 20 years ago, wen dis age group socialise at least as much as pipo for dia 30s or 40s and much more dan dose wey be 50 and older.
Now, instead of spending time wit odas, young pipo dey spend am on social media, gaming and watching TV.
Wit young pipo spending more time online, e go follow say dem dey date for dia too.
But di use of dating apps dey reduce.
According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, di world six biggest dating apps get downloads fall by 18% for 2024 - di first drop for dia history.
Liesel Sharabi, director of di Relationships and Technology Lab at Arizona State University, say users dey frustrated, exhausted and overwhelmed by dating apps - by di quantity of matches but not di quality of connections.
One of di issues she find na di veri little innovation for how dem dey match pipo.
""Men find say dem dey get ignored and dat fit dey uniquely frustrating.""
Dr Sharabi say women dey feel overwhelmed by di number of responses dem dey get.
She also believe say apps don introduce a lack of accountability for dating wey fit lead to rude or inconsiderate behaviour.
""Swipe afta swipe fit feel like say na products, no be pipo dem dey deal wit.""
Hassana from Abuja, in Nigeria, neva get into dating apps.
""E just feel like I dey auction mysef,"" she tok.
But she find offline dating difficult too becos di pool of men wey share her values dey small.
""I be feminist and na di cost of knowledge, e get certain tins I no fit just close my eyes to anymore,"" she tok.
She be 26 and lawyer by training but she dey run one successful laundry business as well as non-governmental organisation (NGO) wey dey support victims of domestic violence.
She believe say widespread access to di internet don give women for Nigeria di freedom to report domestic violence for ways dem neva do bifor wey mean say her generation dey more aware of di dangers of bad relationship.
Survey data from di US, China, South Korea and certain parts of Europe suggest a widening gap between young women - wey dey increasingly more progressive, especially wen e come to women rights - and young men wey dey less.
Dr Alice Evans, wey be sociologist, call am di great gender division and e dey write book on dis subject.
She believe say di way we consume culture online fit be one of di reasons why dis dey happun.
""Women fit watch show wey dey cater to dia increasingly feminist interests wia men fit no dey progress at di exact same rate,"" she tok.
For Hassana, dat na true, too often she don see man wey she dey interested in following a social media account wit misogynistic views or agreeing wit misogynistic comments.
""E dey scary,"" she tok.
For Iran, 40-year-old Nazy get di same problem.
She don dey single and dey look for love for di past 10 years.
But many women still get expectations of a partner wey dey rooted in traditional conservative roles.
Nazy and Hassana dey reluctant to partner wit someone wey no dey as financially secure as dem be.
Di pool of available men dem fit consider as equals dey shrink.
In most kontris, female graduates now outnumber men and girls outperform boys for school.
And wit less stigma around being alone, e dey get easier to opt out of dating, Dr Evans tok.
""Di rise of high quality personal entertainment mean say if dates dey boring, hey, you fit just stay in and watch Bridgerton or play video games,"" she tok.
She believe say na thoroughly good tin if pipo dey under less pressure to make a bad match.
But she dey worried about lack of connection among young pipo.
""If men and women no dey spend time togeda sharing intimate thoughts, sharing dia different perspectives on di world togeda, den e become harder to develop empathy,"" she tok.
Dr Sharabi wey study dating apps, agree say technology don remove some potential for real world connection.
""I get young pipo wey tell me say dem fit see someone cute for bar but dem no go approach dem, dem go go into dating app to see if dem dey dia instead,"" she tok.
At di back of every cancer diagnosis na personal tori  of pain, strength, love and hope.
As millions of pipo don dey battle di disease around di world, every pesin get dia ogbonge tori wey fit into di theme for dis year world cancer day campaign wey be 'united by unique.'
Di theme dey tok about di wahala cancer patients and survivors bin dey go through for dia life, wey pipo no sabi.
One of dis pipo na Mary Amankwah Fordwor wey be ogbonge midwife for di St.
Anthony's catholic hospital for Ghana wey dem diagnose wit throat cancer for 2021.
""I see say my neck swell and e no dey pain me  but di swelling no go away,"" di mama of two tell BBC.

Di Saudi Arabia peace meeting no go include Ukraine wey dey fight wit Russia, and European kontris wey don dey support Ukraine for di more dan two years war.
Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov bin say for Europe no get role for any peace tok, suggesting say Europe want di war to continue.
Lavrov tok dis one as im bin dey leave to go Saudi Arabia for tok tok on Ukraine wit US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.
Ukraine President Zelensky also dey Saudi this week, but im say im no dey involved for di meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin, as nobody invite am.
For di emergency summit for Paris, UK prime minister Keir Sarmer say any settlement wey go happun for di Ukraine war go need to be ""lasting peace deal, not just pause for Putin to come again.""
Starmer add say anoda important issue concerning di war, na di mata of ""wider peace"" wey be di ""collective security and defence of Europe.
After di meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tell tori pipo Reuters say, support for Ukraine must continue, as I add say, nobody fit impose any order on Ukraine.
Scholz say, im no believe say defence suppose be part of EU budget limit and say di union go fit defence imsef by imsef, if kontris for Europe spend more dan 2% of GDP on defence.
Scholz goes on to say that Germany will continue to invest in military spending, and that it must be more flexible with its budget rules.
Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister don first tok say, im ready to put UK peacekeeping troops for Ukraine if and wen di war end.
Europe bin dey expect more aggressive, America-first position from Trump administration, but e dey struggle to catch up as im bin no expect say tins go reach dis extent.
E dey struggle to understand Washington willingness to reach compromises wit Russia about Ukraine, regardless of how e go take affect Europe security.
US decision dey pain European kontris wey fit wan push back.
Dem believe say if dem no do so, dem go end up swallowing indigestible - possibly unsustainable - peace wey dem no go fit enforce.
But again, if dem push back too hard, though, dem risk breaking di transatlantic alliance into wider break.
And Europe influence dey limited, wit military capacity wey no too strong, sake of dem don depend on America security umbrella for years.
United States dey accounts for nearly 43% of all aid wey don go Ukraine since Russia invasion for 2022, according to Kiel Institute for World Economy.
Dis amount na about $120bn and e include all humanitarian, financial and military aid.
Europe as a whole don send less aid to Ukraine than US.
Funding through EU institutions account for just over 18%, wit di largest amounts of additional bilateral aid wey Germany dey provide (6.5%) and UK (5.5%) up to end of 2024.
Germany provide nearly 10% and UK don give nearly 8% up to end of December 2024.
On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer say UK dey ""ready and dey willing to put troops for ground"".
Even for Germany, ahead of one heated election, di foreign policy tok-tok pesin of di CDU party, wey dey expected to win most of di seats say, Europe largest kontri go also commit troops within international framework.
Trump administration no dey 100% sure of wetin dem wan do about Ukraine.
Some mixed messages bin fly ova di weekend.
Dem dey hope to do am via dis Paris meeting.
Europe leaders insist Kyiv must dey directly involved in ceasefire toks too.
For long, dem don maintain di opinion say "" decisions about Ukraine no fit dey, without Ukraine"".
No be all European countries go dey for Monday summit.
Na only those wit military might go UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark  wey dey expected to represent di Baltic and Nordic nations, plus di EU Council president and di secretary general of di defence alliance, Nato.
Even for di small Paris gathering, e go dey hard, if not impossible, to agree on concrete defence spending increases.
Poland dey plan to spend 4.47% of dia GDP on defence for 2025.
UK dey struggle and dem neva reach, 2.5% of dia GDP.
But leaders fit pledge to coordinate beta, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine post-war reconstruction.
Di EU dey expected to boost dia defence effort too.
Large part of di Paris meeting go also focus on di question of sending troops to Ukraine afta a ceasefire.
Di idea dem wan discuss no be about peacekeeping troops but instead, ""reassurance force"", wey dem go station behind, rather dan on any eventual ceasefire line.
Di purpose of di European troop presence go be in three-fold.
Firstly, na to send message to say dem no dey alone.
Another message na to di US, to show say Europe dey ""do dia bit"" for defence of dia own continent, and di last message na to Moscow, to warn say if dem break di terms of an eventual ceasefire, no be only Kyiv dem go dey deal wit."

Fear of raid, detention and deportation don make many African immigrant communities for America dey panic, and dis don force some of dem to go underground.
Immigrants tell BBC say na inside house dem dey stay now, dem dey skip work, reduce dia presence for public functions and no dey allow dia children go school sake of fear say officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) fit detain dem.
One of dem na Kaduli, one Congolese migrant wey enta US 11 years ago.
Dem born Kaduli for Bukavu for di eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, just outside Goma, wey M23 rebels recently capture.
E be general physician bifor e run go DRC to escape arrest afta e criticise di President wey bin dey dia bifor, Joseph Kabila, say e change di constitution to extend im term limit.
Kaduli tell BBC say now im don reduce im movements for di US, wey include visits to restaurants and shopping centres, becos of fear say dem fit forcefully deport am.
""Di current raid dey put us in permanent fear as dem dey confuse all immigrants as criminals, wey no be true,"" e tok.
""I dey fear becos war dey on for Congo.
To send pesin back to Congo na to kill di pesin.""
Like Kaduli, Abdul, from Nigeria, also dey on di edge.
E go America wit im papa, wen e dey 10, dat na 30 years ago.
""I dey caution my waka and get faith in Allah say evri tin go dey alright,"" di Wisconsin resident tok.
Abdul don hear and watch how ICE officials carry out dia operations for oda cities.
E say im dey fear make di same tin no happun to am.
All of us be humans, and all of us dey bleed di same way,"" e tok.
All di migrants we interview for dis tori say make only identify dem by only dia first names, dem dey fear retribution or attention from authorities.
Since e return to di White House for January, di Trump administration don take di mass deportation wit all seriousness, as dem dey raid undocumented migrants for major cities.
E redirect military resources to empower immigration officers to make more arrests, wey include for schools, churches and hospitals.
Dis don draw criticism from civil and immigrant right groups.
Dem don detain thousands of pipo, both criminals and those wey no get criminal histories.
Last week, ICE officers bin intensify dia arrests, as dem dey detain around one thousand pipo evri day.
By comparison, Joe Biden administration bin carry out an average of 311 immigration deportations of mostly criminals daily, according to ICE.
Trump government also dey reason to enforce di Alien Enemies Act, wey go allow authorities to quickly deport migrants dem feel say dey part of an ""invasion or predatory incursion""  one law dem dey only invoke in wartime.
Pious Ali, one Portland city councillor for di state of Maine, tok say while deportations no dey new, dem dey abuse di process by raiding places like schools, churches and synagogues and ""dem dey openly parade pipo"" like criminals.
E say for migrants wey dey worried, e dey important to ""write plan down for your family and put some food and money on di side"".
""If di agent knock for your door, dem no fit enta without a warrant from di court,"" e tok.
Many African migrants dey live in fear sake of di uncertainty around di renewal of dia kontri tenure under di Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme.
Dis dey allow migrants from qualified kontris  usually kontris wey dey witness armed conflict, natural disasters or oda ""extraordinary and temporary"" conditions  safety to stay for di US and apply for work permits.
Sylvie Bello, chief executive of di Cameroon American Council (CAC), one Washington-based organization wey dey advocate for Central African migrants, tok say di current uncertainty na sake of di policies of di previous Biden administration.
She say her community bin hope say Oga Biden go extend di TPS to Angola and DR Congo wen e visit there for November, im only travel go di continent.
""But e fail dem,"" she tok.
""Black Africans wey dem no extend dia TPS fit face deportation now under Trump,"" she tok.
About one million immigrants from 17 kontris  5 for Africa  dey protected by di TPS programme.
""All my communities dey suffer from deportation anxiety,"" Sylvie Bello tok.
In recent years, Africans don increasingly turn to migration routes to enta America through South America and Mexico.
According to di ICE annual report for 2024, dem deport around 1,818 African individuals from di US, wit Senegal, Mauritania, and Nigeria top di list.

""We gatz go through dis for four years or however long dis goes on,"" Abdul tok.
""As pipo face renewed attacks on immigrants, we dey reminded say di strength of African communities lie in working togeda, protecting di most vulnerable, and sharing critical resources,"" she tok.
Achapu believe say dis uncertain time na opportunity for African governments to reorganize themselves, confront di root causes of migration, and create economic opportunities for dia pipo.
""If America continue to push immigrants away, China, Russia, plus oda global powers fit seize di opportunity to expand dia influence in Africa, offering alternative migration pathways, economic partnerships, and trade deals wey fit reshape di US-Africa relations in ways we neva fully grasp,"" she tok."

Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) don tok say di exit of three kontris as member states don take effect on Wednesday 29 January 2025.
One year ago Burkina Faso, di Republic of Mali, and Republic of Niger announce dia exit from di bloc.
But di move by di Sahel State kontries to launch dia own common passport mean say to go back no too sure.
Ecowas further tok say di arrangements go dey in place until leaders of di join-bodi go fully determine how future engagements wit di three kontries go be.
Di Commission say structure don dey ground to arrange tok-tok about di wey tins go be now wit kontries one by one.
Dem say all dis arrangement dey key so confusion and disturb no go dey for lives and businesses of pipo during di transition period.
Di three kontris bin go ahead to form one Sahel state.
Military-led Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, wey form di three Sahel neighbours officially comot di West Africa regional bloc on Wednesday.
Di junta leaders wey now dey under di platform of di Alliance of Sahel State (AES) bin tok say di move na part of efforts to strengthen cooperation between Member States.
According to tori pipo, di new passport dey expected to become functional from Wednesday 29 January and go replace di Ecowas passport wey citizens of di three kontries.
Di Sahel authorities dey encourage pipo to register for di new passport, although dem add say di pipo Ecowas passports go remain valid until di day e expire.
On Tuesday 28 January, hundreds of pro-juntas' demonstrators for Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger for one rally bin enta streets to show support to di decision to comot di regional bloc.
For Niger, members of di military bin lead plenti pipo wey reach thousands regime to gather around one square for di capital Niamey.
Dem kontinu dia waka towards di national assembly wit chants of unfriendly slogans to French President Emmanuel Macron and oda leaders for di region.
Sometin similar also happun for Burkina Faso, wia di Prime Minister Rimtalba Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo, members of di govment and thousands odas bin gather for Ouagadougou Nation square to rally in support of di development.
No rally bin hold for Mali but development still dey expected acress di regions.
Dis kontries exit na big deal for Ecowas, as di bloc go need deep reassessment of im future wey appear to dey uncertain.
Ecowas say di Sahel states get six month grace period wey go run till July, to reconsider dia positions, in case dem decide to dey readmitted.
Make we take you back to how di exit of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso from Ecowas begin.
E bin start wen di Ecowas Authority of Heads of State and Government - wey Nigeria President Bola Tinubu be di Chairman - threaten to use military force to comot di military junta wey take ova power from Niger Republic for 2023.
Na afta dat di three kontris exit and dem officially announce di new alliance.
Dem redesign dia passport and comot di Ecowas logo, recently, although dem announce visa-free travel and residency rights to citizens of Ecowas kontris but we neva sabi how e go be now, wen di exit don take effect.
Dem bin tok say di decision na in di spirit of friendship, and to strengthen centuries-old ties among African pipo.
Political sabi pipo dey worry say travel restrictions go further weaken regional integration, worsen di ease of doing business, and slow economic development if e dey effective.
Now, di three kontris go lose di duty-free trade benefits among member states wey Ecowas members dey enjoy.
Travel fit become difficult for oda West Africans wey go visit di Sahel kontries.
Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger dey landlocked wit no access to di sea, and dis go make dem dependent on dia coastal neighbours including Togo, Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria for international trade.
According to Ecowas Trade Information Systems (ECOTIS), for 2022, Mali exports total $3.91 billion, wit imports of $6.45 billion, while Burkina Faso export na $4.55 billion, and import na $5.63 billion.
Na for December 2000 dem introduce di Ecowas passport, and e provide di den fifteen member kontries wit visa-free movements within di region and function as international travel document.
Ecowas citizens get di right to live within member kontri for up to three months, but dis fit change for those wey go visit kontries wey no longer be part of di regional bloc.
Also, wit intermarriages bin dey common especially around border areas.
Example na between Nigeria and Niger, Ghana and Burkina Faso, and odas.
Some family members wey wan visit relatives for Sahel kontries go now need visas to fit enta and e go be so for di Sahel states pipo too.
Dis na serious mata as e go further make weak regional integration.
Also business, economic development, and di continental free trade agreement go dey affected."

Di second contract wey dem sign na between Congo Protection, one Congolese company wey Thierry Kongolo dey represent, and Asociatia RALF.
According to UN experts, di contract show say Asociatia RALF get expertise and extensive experience for di provision of security management services.
Dem go provide training and instruction to di Congolese troops on di ground through contingent of 300 instructors, many of dem Romanians.
Wen I follow Oga Potra tok for July about di extent of im group involvement on di ground and weda dem follow for di fight, e ""We gatz protect ourselves.
If M23 attack us, dem no go 'Oh, una just be instructors - go house'.""
Dem dramatically arrest am for December, and e deny providing security for di pro-Russian, far-right candidate Clin Georgescu.
And since October, e don refuse to return di BBC calls.
Di ex-mercenary, wey dey im his late forties and follow BBC tok on condition of anonymity, tok say im bin resign becos im dey unhappy on how Asociatia RALF deu operate.
E say di Romanians do plenty things on ground for North Kivu ""Only very few of us be trainers.
""We dey work long shifts of up to 12 hours, dey guard key positions outside Goma.""
E maintain say di money no worth di risks di military contractors gatz take.
""Missions dey disorganised, working conditions poor.
Make Romanians stop dey go there becos e dey dangerous.""
E also claim say dem no do proper background checks, and some of di Romanian recruits no get military training  e use di example of one of im former colleagues wey be firefighter.
DR Congo government neva reply to BBC request for comment on weda dem carry out background checks, or about di pay disparity between di private contractors and Congolese troops.
Di family of Vasile Badea, one of two Romanians wey die last February wen M23 fighters ambush one army convoy wey dey on dia way to Sake, one frontline town near Goma, tell BBC say na police officer im be.
Di 46-year-old bin take sabbatical from di force and take up di role for DR Congo sake of di beta salary offer.
Di policeman bin dey struggle to pay for one apartment e just get and need money to pay for am.
Many more Romanians bin dey lured sake of di prospect of a well-paid job.
I meet one man for Bucharest for October, who go back im kontri dey find more recruits to go to Goma.
""We dey very busy trying to find 800 pipo wey need to dey mentally prepared for di job and sabi how to fight,"" di mercenary recruiter tell BBC.
""Dem dey place di recruits for positions wey correspond to di level of dia training, ande dem dey earn between $400-$550 per day,"" e explain.
Wen dem ask am about di recruitment process, e say e dey confidential.
""Dem no dey publish dis kain work anywhere,"" e tok, and add say na on networks like WhatsApp you go see am.
E show me one WhatsApp group where more dan 300 Romanians don sign up, many of dem be ex-military personnel.
For June last year, Rwanda government tok-tok pesin Yolande Makolo bin kick against di presence of mercenaries for eastern DR Congo, e say na violation of di Geneva Conventions, wey prohibit di use of hired combatants.
In response, Congolese government tok-tok pesin Patrick Muyaya dismiss wetin e call Rwanda perennial complaint.
""We get some instructors wey dey come train our military forces becos we know say we get urgent situation,"" e tell BBC.
But one Congolese soja wey I meet for June express dia disappointment ova di army strategy.
""Di pay dey unfair.
Wen e come to fighting, na us dem dey send go di front lines first,"" e tell BBC on condition of anonymity.
""Dem [di mercenaries] dey only come as back-up.""
E confam say im pay na around $100 a month, but e no dey come on time or make dem no pay at all.
I follow am tok last week ago, and e confam say im stll dey stationed for Kibati, near Goma, where di army get base.
""Things dey very bad,"" e tok for one voice note to me.
I no fit reach out to am since then - and M23 don take ova di base since and kill many sojas, including dia commander.
Observers say di quick fall of Goma point to DR Congo fractured defence strategy, where overlapping forces plus blurred lines of command later fall into di hands of M23.
Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group project director for di Great Lakes, say mercenaries, di Congolese army work wit troops from di Southern African Development Community (Sadc), one local militia wey dey known as Wazalendo, plus sojas from Burundi also lead to di fall.
""E create situation wia e dey impossible to plan military attack wen chain of command and responsibility dey messed up,"" e tell BBC.
""I think say e dey important to work towards far greater coherence in di armed effort for North Kivu, probably reduce di number of armed groups or armed actors on di ground.""
For di ex-mercenary, di fate of im former Romanian colleagues no come as surprise.
Di Democratic Republic of Congo dey inside serious trouble as fighters from di M23 rebel group don dey enta through di kontri east and dey battle di national army and dem dey capture key places as dem dey go.
So how DR Congo, wey be di biggest kontri for sub-Saharan Africa, carry demselves reach dis level?
You fit understand di start of dis kasala if you torchlight di tori of one man, M23 leader Sultani Makenga wey don dey accused of plenti war crimes allegations.
To look into Makenga life na to look into decades of war, some foreign intervention and di lure of DR Congo rich mineral resources.
Im life start on Christmas day of 1973 wen dem born for di lush Congolese town for Masisi.
E bin dey raised by Tutsi parents, and at di age of 17 e comot school to join one Tutsi rebel group for Rwanda.
Di group wey dem call di Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) bin dey ask for more Tutsi representation for Rwanda goment wey dat time bin dey full of politicians from di Hutu majority.
Dem bin also want di hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees wey ethnic kasala bin pursue comot di kontri make dem come back house.
For four years, Makenga and di RPF bin fight di Hutu filled army for Rwanda.
Di fight-fight join wit di 1994 genocide wen Hutu extremists bin kill 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
Wen e bin look dis time for one rare interview for 2013, Makenga ""My life na war, my education na war and my language na war...
Di RPF seize more and more lands small-small bifor dem match enta di Rwanda capital of Kigali so dem go overthrow di extremist Hutu goment, and many of dem run enta wetin today be DR Congo.
Wit RPF for power, Makenga come join di official Rwandan army and rise to di rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander.
One of Makenga fellow RPF fighters tell di RIft Valley Institute wey be non-profit research organisation say, ""e bin dey very good wit setting up ambushes"".
Im progress for di Rwandan army sha take style hang.
Di fact say e bin get only basic education and fit speak broken French and English bin dey stand as ""challenge to im military career"", according to di Rift Valley Institute.
Dem also tok say, till today, Makenga dey very reserved and dey find am hard to tok for public.
For 1997, e bin dey part of di Rwandan-backed forces wey las-las take ova power for DR Congo and comot long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko.
To replace am, dem put veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila.
Rwandan authorities bin arrest am afta im refuse orders to go back to Rwanda, according to one UN Security Council report.
So, dem imprison am for many years for di island of Iwawa.
Meanwhile, di relationship between Kabila and Rwanda new leaders start to scata.
Rwanda bin wan crush di Hutu militiamen wey bin dey responsible for di genocide but dem run across di border for 1994.
Rwanda bin fear say dem go come back and scata di kontri stability wey dem don struggle to win.
But Kabila bin fail to stop di militants from organising and e also comot di Rwandan troops by force.
Wen Makenga bin dey released from prison, dem appoint am as commander for di front line wit one Rwanda backed rebel group.
Ova di years, e gain di reputation from being very strategic and skilled wit commanding large group of sojas to battle.
Afta Rwanda troops cross enta DR Congo, discrimination against di Tutsi community start to increase again.
Kabila bin allege say di Tutsis support di invasion while oda officials bin ginger di public to attack members of di ethnic group.
Makenga wey still dey DR Congo bin accuse di Congolese leader say im betray Tutsi fighters ""Kabila na politician, and I no be politician.
I be soja and di language wey I sabi na gun.""
More dan five million pipo, na im dey believed say bin die for di war and afta.
Most of dem bin die from starvation or disease.
Di fight-fight bin officially end for 2003 but Makenga continue to dey work for armed groups to di Congolese goment.
In di spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga bin las-las join di Congolese goment armed forces for wetin dem call ""mixage"".
But di political stands for DR Congo dey always shift, and na so Makenga defect from di army to join di M23 rebellion wey bin dey on di rise.
Di M23 bin don dey very active for DR Congo east say dem dey fight for Tutsi rights and goment no gree honour peace deal wey dem sign for 2009.
Makenga bin dey elevated to di rank of M23 general and den soon reach di top position.
For November 2012, e lead di rebels for ogbonge fight-fight, from wia dem capture di city of Goma, wey be major eastern city wey get ova one million pipo.
DR Congo and di UN bin accuse di Rwanda Tutsi full goment say dem back di M23.
Kigali don deny dis allegation many times.
But recently di official statement don shift, as goment tok-tok pipo say to fight near di border na security threat.
By 2012, Makenga and odas for M23 dey face serious war crimes accuse.
Makenga say di accuse say M23 dey use pikin as sojas dey ""baseless"".
Di US also say e don commit and dey responsible for tins like killing and maiming, sexual kasala and kidnapping.
Apart from asset freezes, Makenga bin also dey face bitter division for inside di M23.
One side back am as dia leader while di oda bin support im rival, Gen Bosco Ntaganda.
Di Enough Project wey be non-profit group wey dey work for DR Congo say di two sides bin enta full war for 2013 wey kill three sojas and eight civilians.
Makenga side bin wine and Ntaganda run enta Rwanda wia e surrender to di US embassy.
Gen Ntaganda wey dem bin nickname ""Terminator"" bicos of im brutality, bin dey sentenced to 30 years in prison for war crimes by di International Criminal Court (ICC).
But months afta di Makenga win, anoda bigger threat bin come.
Di UNbin deploy one 3,000 force wit di mission to support di Congolese military to fit take back Goma and ginger di M23 to withdraw.
Di rebel group bin dey expelled from di kontri and Makenga bin run enta Uganda, anoda kontr wey dem accuse say dey support M23, wey dem too don deny.
Uganda don receive extradition request from DR Congo for Makenga but dem no act on am.
Eight years later, plenti armed groups still dey scata di mineral-rich east of DR Congo but at least authorities dey free from dia most notorious militants.
Makenga and im rebels carry weapons again anf take ova territory for di North Kivu province.
Several ceasefires between di M23 and di Congolese authorities don fail.
Even sef last year one udge sentence Makenga to death in im absence.
For M23 latest advance, wey tori be say na thousands of Rwandan troops dey support di rebels, pipo neva too see Makenga in public.
Instead na im tok-tok pesin and Corneille Nangaa wey be oga of alliance of rebel groups wey include M23 na im dey run public speeches and statements.
But Makenga still be key player, and e be like say na behind di scene strategy e dey focus on.
E don tok say im fighting na for im three pikin, ""so dat one day dem go get bata future for dis kontri"".
E tok say, ""make una no look me as pesin wey no want peace o.
I get heart and family and pipo wey I care about"".
But millions of ordinary pipo dey pay di price for dis kasala and if Congolese forces catch am, Makenga dey look death sentence.
Yet e no dey shake am.
E say, ""I dey willing to sacrifice evritin""."

If e kon see say di same criminals wey cause am pain don come back dey live normal life, e fit wan take action by imsef.""
""Plenty pipo dey sell dia property just to find money take free dia relatives from kidnappers.

A BBC investigation don uncover allegations say energy giant Shell don ignore repeated warnings say a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria get problems and corruption.
Di multinational wey get headquarters for London, along wit di Nigerian goment, don constantly tok say work to clean up oil-polluted sites of Ogoni, wey kick-off around eight years ago, dey go on well.
One close observer describe di clean-up project as a ""con"" and a ""scam"" wey don waste money and leave di pipo of Ogoni for di Niger Delta region to dey live wit di serious impact of oil pollution - 13 years afta a ground-breaking UN report lift di cover on di seriousness of dia situation.
Shell tell di ""Di operating environment for di Niger Delta still dey challenging becos of di level of illegal activities such as oil theft.
""Wen spills happun from our facilities we dey clean up and remediate, regardless of di cause.
If na operational spill, we also dey compensate pipo and communities.""
Di allegations come as a civil trial dey expected to begin on Thursday for di High Court in London, wia lawyers wey dey represent two Ogoni communities of around 50,000 inhabitants go say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution wey occur between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from dia infrastructure.
Di communities say di spills don leave dem without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and create serious risks to public health.
Shell, wey don dey push to sell dia assets for di West African kontri to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, don indicate say dem go defend di claims.
Dem deny any wrongdoing and say spills for di region dey caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining wey di company say dem no dey liable.
Di UN say at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil don dey spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents for di Niger Delta region.
Di spills don leave many families worried for dia health and livelihoods.
Her family and neighbours only get access to a contaminated borehole, forcing dem to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, 2.40) - for area wia di average daily wage dey less dan $8.
Paulina Agbekpekpe tell di BBC say lush greenery wey bin once surround di mangroves of her community for Bodo - wey no be one of dos wey dey go court on Thursday.
She say di rivers and ponds wey dem dey use dey full wit different kain animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.
""Di place bin dey greener, not only mangroves, but all by di shoreline - e bin get pawpaw trees, palm trees and more.
But during di spills, di destruction don pollute evriwia,"" di 50-year-old mother of six tok.
Her family for generations don survive on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.
""Most of di children - from di drinking water - don get diseases.
Many don die.
Me I don lose eight kids.
My husband dey sick.
""Becos dem don take away our livelihoods, pipo for Bodo dey hungry and dem dey suffer.""
In 2011, di UN Environment Programme (UNEP) bin publish a major study into di impact of pollution on di oil-rich area.
Dem find out say members of one community for Ogoniland dey drink water wey dey polluted wit a known carcinogen at levels more dan 900 times above di World Health Organization (WHO) guideline.
Di same chemical, benzene, dey detected in all dia air samples.
Dem also find out say sites wey Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claim say dem don remediate, still dey polluted and di techniques dem use bin no reach regulatory requirements.
Di report conclude say a comprehensive clean-up of di area go take 25-30 years - and e lead to di formation of di Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).
Dis bin initially dey established by di Nigerian goment in 2012, but no clean-up start - until e come dey relaunched by a new goment in December 2016.
However, di BBC don see internal documents wey suggest say Nigerian goment bin warn representatives of Shell plenty times of di agency alleged fraudulent practices.
One pesin wey dey aware of di project tok to di BBC about dia concerns - and ask to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.
Most of am na to fool di Ogoni pipo,"" di whistleblower tok.
Di allegations about failings for Hyprep
In di minutes of one meeting for 2023, wey representatives from Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di UNEP and Hyprep attend, dem point out say ""incompetent"" contractors ""dey engaged again"" and say make dem  no dey allowed to further degrade di environment"".
In a separate leaked report wey di BBC see from di same year, dem point out say laboratory results bin dey ""regularly reported wit deviations"".
In 2022, di UN write to Nigeria environment ministry, wit warning say if nothing change, di ""extremely poor standards"" of di clean-up go kontinu.
Di BBC has ask HYPREP and di Nigerian goment to comment on di allegations but neva get any response.
But our investigation don reveal evidence say Shell dey aware of di problems.
In a meeting wit di British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes wey we obtain under di Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledge di ""institutional challenges"" of di clean-up agency and di chance of di refusal of ""future funding"" toward am.
Shell tell di ""Hyprep na agency wey dey established and overseen by di federal goment of Nigeria, wit dia governing council largely include senior ministers and goment officials, along wit five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single Shell representative.""
Dis no be di only remediation project for Ogoniland wey allegedly no dey work.
In 2015, Shell agree to a 55m settlement for a clean-up afta two catastrophic spills in 2008 from dia infrastructure in di Bodo area.
Di company say di clean-up, wey di Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) do, wey suppose to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and di Bodo community (and dey part-funded by di oil giant and Nigerian regulators) bin dey certified as 98% complete.
However, di BBC visit sites within di area and find say crude oil still dey smell from di soil and dey float ontop water.
Shell and di BMI insist say any occurrences of oil spills for di region na becos of theft - dem sabi in di industry as ""oil bunkering"".
""Plans dey to call back di contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,"" Boniface Dumpe, a director for di BMI, tell di BBC.
""Na di responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of dia facilities, to ensure say re-oiling no go come from dia facilities.
""But for di areas wey dey cleaned.
I go think say some responsibility also dey for di community to ensure say some illegal activities no go also cause re-pollution.""
Shell say dem don take active measures to prevent oil spills wey oil bunkering cause.
Di company ""We don take advanced steps to prevent dis activity and di spills e dey cause including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.""
Di alleged failings in di oil clean-up come as Shell dey prepare to sell dia Nigerian subsidiary, di SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.
Some locals in Ogoniland don accuse di oil giant of ""running away"" from properly cleaning up di land and water wey dem allegedly don pollute.
Dem also fear say Shell fit still gain from di area by simply trading di oil extracted from di region in future.
""Di operations of whichever oil operator go take over di relevant pipelines go get ogbonge impact on dia day-to-day life,"" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, tell di BBC.
Dem get incredibly little detail about wetin diz deals go lead to.
""E dey unclear how Renaissance [Africa] go act going forward.
At least wit Shell we get means of holding dem to account.""
Locals, wey dia main source of livelihood na agriculture and fishing, tell di BBC say since di discovery of oil, or wetin some refer to as ""black gold"", dia home don dey pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.
Dem say dem neva see any benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe wey blame recent oil spills for her failing crops.
""Formerly if I harvest I fit eat some wit my family and even sell some...

What makes Lagos assembly own different?How does this make a joke out of the business, educational, investment and Tech aspect of Lagos or you just be one Nnamdi Kanu bloda wey wan talk for talking sake?Scroll past if you have no related meaningful contributions to If Na Tinubu doings which i think it is, then i totally Concur  When the speaker was removed, I know many of you haters said that he was removed because he was a threat to Tinubu's son, so you guys should not come and change mouth now and start saying something else.If you called people slaves because you imagined that he was removed because Lagos landlord as you guys like to call him wanted him removed, please no changing of mouth now that it seems you guys were lying on him all these while.
Even when Tinubu intervened in Rivers State crisis, he asked Wike faction to stop the impeachment process against Fubara.So, what Tinubu doing now is what would make GAC united?
that is his own hustle, 100 naira per page post

Hope his voice is not clone sha.
Baba fit dey test A.I voice .
that's were the miscalculation takes place, although I understand the pain watching Oga Obasa trying to enjoy three terms ..
If the current speaker must resign they should be a gentle lady agreement, make she enjoy the office for three months chop her own , then resign, then a new speaker can then be elected.
Wahala don happen!
Another senior actress don born for billionaire, little billionaire wife don run comot for Instagram.
Ah, which kind wahala be this?While Regina Daniels and Ned Nwoko have yet to address the rumors, the sudden social media disappearance of the actress has only intensified public curiosity about the state of their marriage.
I might still sample dat girl...I been dey think say she don escape ni
Too many men fathering secret children outside of their marriages.Na only their mumu wives I dey sha pity cos many of them are in the darkMy husband this, my husband that, but na community preeq you marry

When Ned and Chika start to run things, Regina still dey primary school for Benita.
Girls/ladies should stop walking about, they should leave men alone, except you are courting someone.We in nairaland.com should educate our female relatives and neighbours, let's inform them on what is happening in Nigeria now.They are doing organ harvesting, forest between River State and Owerri, River State and Abia state is full of dead bodies, they sell people's body parts to doctors.Organ harvesting is the yahoo yahoo in Nigeria, be careful, trust no one, everybody is a suspect.Let's educate people around us, kidnapping and killing is going on everyday in Nigeria.Why has Tinubu not sentenced this people to death by hanging, is suspicious, how can a president not do anything to people that are caught with human parts?We need to impeachment Tinubu for this offence, they should let Nigerians know if they are the ones sending them, if they are not, why are they still alive?Why has he refused to sign there death warrant.Nigerians should better wakeup,Nigeria politicians will not allow Nigerians have a life, why?Everthing is expensive, security not guaranteed again in Nigeria.Everybody is quiet as if everything is OK, we need to take this issue seriously.Nigerians have a right to live and not be killed by ritualists.If Tinubu is not ready to kill this people by firing squad, he should resign.Why are we quiet over this issue?Why?Nobody knows the next victim,People are kidnapped in River State forest, if parents don't meet up, the victim is killed and there body parts sold.Nigerians wake up from sleep, there is fire on the mountain, nobody knows who will be there next victim
you married someone's husband and you are expecting him to be faithful to you..You dey mad...He will soon marry emmanuela and you will no longer be number one.Dddd
Why should she angry or fight?You use ur leg walked into polygamous family, Abi u thought you would be the last, becos you are famous?
She no be person husband she marry?
For dream...
possibleReality...in your dreams.Even for dream sef...
Na still something
Ned na public toilet.
Regina wey be no 5 should know that there will be no 6.
Ned is the trophy  as Blessing CEO would say in Tubaba's case.
What is his role?So because Nigeria football team is going to America to play a feiendly match, the Nigerian president would follow them just to gibe them a moral boost?Una no get work!
Unfortunately, those guys don't have regards for Nigeria.
If they say only 21 people were supposed to go for the games, why then are they saying the presence of the CDS would have made a difference?
Oga person wey him house dey born no pursue rat stay naija fight boko haram
Hmmmmmmm, they want cover their shame, even their shame dey shame me
who is fooling who now?
Why are Canadian Generals not begging to come to Nigeria?Good question.They simply want to go there and flex as usual but this time it backfired.Now they have come out to tell us cork and bull story.Dem shoot bird pikin em mama fly
Make the die this matter already.It's not that deep
Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.It is on record that the Chief of Defence Staff has initiated laudable efforts to boost morale of our service personnel who risk their lives to protect our nation and its people.The CDS didn't go into Sambisa forest to boost the morale of service personnel who are in the heat of battle, but can go for winter games in Canada.Na wah o!
All this our generals don cast, i like as dem dey collect gbas gbos everywhere.
Which one be CDS presence to boost troops morale?
Una no add to their salaries and welfare to boost their morale, na presence of CDS dem go chop?

If you take a keen look, you will notice that they always go after Pastor Morka, and his "Lord choosen" and now this man.The same thing they're doing in the betting industry,  banking industry,  oil industry and in politics with the APC, which is to ostracise, demonise and crucify all eastern potential competitors...sheybi u igbos hyped odumeje sote u started comparing him with AdeboyeNow your eye don clear, u can't measure up to Yoruba in anything

Your tribal people are behind U 100%.

But then again, this is nigeria, most things rarely make sense here
And so?
These are crafts that make people rich in developed countries.I don't understand the need to upload this video though.Is he trying to make gatemen and cleaners look less employed or what?These are people doing honest jobs that will take them to heaven after their earthly lives.
They decided to keep it clean rather than soil their lives for millions.I am not saying they can't be better in life.

The lady intentionally recruited them (though they don't  give the vibes of  First Class quality) to prove a point that she can diminish and spite what graduating with a First Class, represents......a reflection of her insecurity.

But the practical that's on a long thing.So Nigerians in the diaspora are getting the theory explained by Nigerian teachers and the practical will be done in the abroad where they are residing.If you ask me, that's a two factor assurance - so brilliant.
Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria.
Laslas.
Please am interested.
To the good of our economy in Nigeria.But I don't really see the effectiveness of it as one done physically there.
Make the teachers remit tax to government o!
This will even make our Nigerian children to top their classes.
Moreover, it's a way some teachers earn a bit more to augment poor pay from school.You'll be shocked to know that some of these teachers make more than their salary doing this and for just about 3hrs a week.Sometimes the children are grouped in classes which means the teacher can earn even more.Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria.
It is only a ludicrous person that'd say Nigerian Teachers teach cut and join English, when it is conspicuous that we have several English Language Teachers that know their onions.

UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is "ready and willing" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was "essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future".Before attending an emergency summit with European leaders in Paris on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"."I do not say that lightly," he wrote.
"I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."The prime minister "But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country."The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again", Sir Keir said.UK troops could be deployed alongside soldiers from other European nations alongside the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory.Sir Keir's announcement comes after the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, told the BBC the UK military was "so run down" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.The PM has previously only hinted that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire.He is due to visit President Donald Trump in Washington later this month and said a "US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again".Sir Keir is meeting with other European leaders in response to concerns the US is moving forward with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say.On Saturday the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted only and not take part in any talks between the US and Russia.A senior Ukrainian government source told the BBC on Sunday that Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia.Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the "ridiculous war" in Ukraine would begin "immediately".Trump then "informed" Zelensky of his plan.On Sunday, Trump said that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks.

lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District, Ali Ndume, has asked the Federal Government to probe a claim by US Congressman Scott Perry that aborted United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded terrorist organisations, including Boko Haram.You canTMt say itTMs just an allegation; itTMs more than that, the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army said on Channels TelevisionTMs Sunday Politics programme.ThatTMs why the Nigerian government and the National Assembly, especially, need to look into it to investigate and verify the veracity of such a very weighty allegation.The lawmaker, who has been in the National Assembly for more than 20 unbroken years, said the Nigerian government should be interested in the US congressmanTMs revelation, considering that there had been suspicions that foreign humanitarian agencies operating in NigeriaTMs insurgent-ridded North-East zone sponsored terrorist activities.Ndume said, This development is very worrisome, especially because one of the terrorist organisations mentioned by Scott Perry is Boko Haram, and Boko Haram has ravaged not only the North-East but even (other parts of) Nigeria.You can remember Boko Haram bombed the police headquarters and the UN office in Abuja, and the casualties were enormous.
Very devish man

You need to listen to what the US rep said before you misconstrue.He said the US still gives taliban money, and assistance for women who the country donTMt even allow to talkHe said how do you expect that money to be used for aid in Afghanistan when a terrorist and bin ladinTMs son are in charge?
Very devish man
There is still a chance to live a normal hate-free man, don't let your life go to waste like this.
Cos there's no way for a rag tag terrorist to sustain operations for more than 15 years non stop if funding is not coming from someone
Like every other things you probe in nigeria, please don't waste our money, blaming the USA is not going to solve anything

Who aid elp
You make a good points here just like ordinary southern Nigeria doesn't aware that aid has been given to a northern Nigeria by federal government and southern Nigeria dont benefit from it.Common man does not know anything like aid exist in this government.
Let all forms of aid stop, those who steal from it will cry more on our behalf because they have been enjoying them on our behalf.Oga, rest!
Common man dey enjoy aid from America.
All those expensive drugs that people used to buy 1 kobo you don't know that Americans fund most of them?
Will they ever think, instead they will start imposing taxes on the people, different sectors are there, tourism, entertainment, solid minerals na lie they will never think
Common man dey enjoy aid from America.
All those expensive drugs that people used to buy 1 kobo you don't know that Americans fund most of them?
Where does the money come from?The problem of most Nigerians is clearly ignorance.The only thing is the antiretroviral drugs which I don't know if is killing us or helping us.
Common man dey enjoy aid from America.
All those expensive drugs that people used to buy 1 kobo you don't know that Americans fund most of them?
Nah, a broke country won't do all that.It's time for us to be innovative.
Common man dey enjoy aid from America.

Some reverend fathers see themselves as demi-gods, especially those in the East, I was told of one over-pampered and worshiped reverend father that was asking people to knell down and he would flog them once you come to the church late, my father was telling me about this and I thought it was just a joke until I traveled to the village and we went to service together, it was 4am and my dad was already panicking and waking everyone up to bath and get ready as the service states by 6amWe all got ready before 30 since the church wasn't far from our house, but unfortunately my car battery was very low and we had to remove the battery and jump start it with another car before it moved, we got to the church by 25 and the Reverend father had locked the church entrance and people were knelling down and waiting for him to come and flog them and to allow them enter, I was parked and came down, strolled to the church entrance and I was flabbergasted with what I saw, people fathers and mothers with white hair knelling down, I was provoked, and I also saw youths there and none could say anything, I waited patiently until he came out with long koboko, I tell my dad that if this man flogs any one here I was going to punch him, my dad knew I don't bluff and he started begging me, my mum was urging me on to please punch him.
He came out and started flogging people 4 lashes before you are allowed to enter, I walked straight to him and started making videos, I told him that I was going to post the video and report his conduct, he ordered the mass servants to collect my phone from me, me way they secretly look for a way to fight since, I been dey gym everyday I didn't know I was preparing for this battle all my life     .They came with force and I punched the guy straight on his nose and he fell down straight, the second one rushed me, and I picked him up and dropped him on the ground like a bag of rubbish, he stood up and ran away, to my surprise everyone was cheering me on instead of try to stop the fight, including my mom      .The next thing I heard on my back was tawai, I looked back and it was the revered father, he had flogged me with his koboko, omo, I just held him his hands, collected the koboko, and started flogging the werey like mad, I made sure I started from this head, before police came in to separate the fight, him head don get plenty gallops of injury     , the most annoying thing is that he's just a young priest, not more than 28 years old, I dealt with the idiot to my satisfaction, jump inside the car with my family and drove home, my mum was just healing me as we drove home after making statement at the police    That was it, my parent later told me after I had done back to Abuja that the our community igwe reported him to the convent and  they never went back to the church the next Sunday, the removed him and suspended him, and brought another Reverend come and see jubilation

Quickly bring everything to Lagos ooooo, because this is ur best chance.
Keep conering everything to Lagos.
Emilokan.
Lagos lo kan
Keep conering everything to Lagos.There is nothing nepotistic here.By merit, within Nigeria, Lagos as the busiest maritime area is the most suitable location for such international maritime organisation.Don't forget that along side Lagos, Accra, Abidjan, Dakar (Senegal) will likely compete for this organisation.Port Harcourt, Calabar, Warri, Uyo etc are not in the same class as those West African Port cities.
Keep conering everything to Lagos.
Keep conering everything to Lagos.That's because his asset is mostly in Lagos.
Remember Atlantic city!Well, the ripple effect sha will be there though but his assets are the main beneficiaries.
Keep conering everything to Lagos.So, you would have preferred your cursed Mkpurumini land as the location of the AU maritime office?
Keep conering everything to Lagos.And you think Nigeria will grow like that?

French President, Emmanuel Macron has reportedly scheduled an emergency meeting for European leaders to discuss United States President Donald Trump.Fox News, citing Politico, reports that Polish Foreign Minister Radosaw Sikorski on Saturday made an allusion to the meeting at the Munich Security Conference.According to the report, two EU officials told the Politico that the meeting would take place on Monday.ITMm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris, Sikorski was quoted as saying, noting that the event would involve talking about the implications of TrumpTMs actions in a very serious fashion.Sikorski has not shied away from discussing US politics in the past.He previously compared President Joe BidenTMs poor debate performance to the decline of ancient Rome, while at other time said Trump was right to say that NATO countries need to spend more on their own defense.The report further noted that Macron has been cordial to Trump since the latterTMs reelection in November last year.The French leader had, in a post on X, expressed a willingness to work with Trump.Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump, MacronTMs post read.
Donald Trump wahala  ...
Na Trump go discuss ur matter ...
No be u go discuss trump matter!!!!
Wetin Dem wan discuss
U better becareful so u won't buy market
Na Trump go discuss ur matter ...
No be u go discuss trump matter!!!!Because Trump is acting like a very erratic.He wants to annex CanadaHe wants to buy GreenlandHe wants to evic Gazans and turn their home into real estateAny one will wonder where those things are coming from
Wetin Dem wan discussTrust me.
you guys don't confront the madman, he would bully you for entire 4 years he wants to spend as a president.It makes him happy wen he treats "high and mighty" with disdain, but wen you confront him back, he would retreat.You can see how he is treating Putin with respect, since he knows Putin too not a push-over.
I wonder wetin Macron dey fear.
Soon France yansh go open .

You just love to make yourself happy with whatever narrative you have in your mind.
However, the Nigerian government, in its Friday response, accused Mr Gambaryan of making false claims.Information Minister Mohammed Idris said the allegations are not only unsubstantiated but also lack credibility, given his apparent motive to discredit and intimidate those who ensured he faced justice.In response, the American insisted, on Saturday, that what he said was factual.What I shared was factual, based on my personal experiences and conversations with those who have direct knowledge of the events I discussed.He added that he shared the information with both Nigerian and US law enforcement.Opposition reactA former Nigerian senator, Ben Murray-Bruce, said he believes the allegations against Mr Ribadu are false and baseless.I have known Mallam Nuhu Ribadu my entire life, and I can say with absolute certainty that he is incapable of the allegations being levelled against him, Mr Murray-Bruce, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said.
The NSA has not publicly announced such ambition.You can say anything against Nuhu Ribadu but not the issue of stealing public funds or demanding bribes from any human being.
None of them there is an oppositionThe same Deji that has been shouting that all the Nigerian politicians are the same is now trying to exonerate one person that he has never mentioned before as exceptional.An Igbo adage says as translated...wetin fall for ground don touch sand.Mr integrity my foot, if Buhari that I so much adore for many years only ended as Mr integrity (mai gaskiya)in disguise, who else can't decieve Nigerians with integrity mantraMaybe and only maybe Mr Peter Obi
shey Ribadu is immune from doing same?
Guy, don't always be a hater to all issues on nairaland.
Even you self know say nobody is as honest as Ribadu in your entire region.The man is one of the two honest men that the entire Northeast region has.Who are the opposition leaders?Bruce that has been singing Tinubus praises from the beginning and looking for appointment?Or Deji Adeyanjus thats an undercover agent for Tinubu?The dame Deji that tells Nigerians always to forget 2027, that no one can unseat Tinubu?

Which high-ranking government official will want to collect bribe and feel the need to tell you he needs the bribe for his presidential aspirations come 2027.If an NSA wants a bribe, why does he need to mention what he needs the bribe forThe Indian man is telling porkies.well according to the binance guy his team was told by the team representing the NSA, not that Mr ribadu told him that himself, and also the reason why he was told that may just be for him not to feel that he is being extorted unfairly to make it seem like the extortion is for a worthy cause, and justifiable.
They say Buhari was the only one pulling APC together and after he leaves office, APC would split but today, the reverse is the case.
It is done and dusted.After God, na Tinubu a God bless Nigeria
I don't support evil; so I don't support him.

Who are the major northern leaders that are against president Tinubu?Me sha know say Buhari, Abdusalam and Babangida are not amongst those scheming against his Excellency
Bro , ignore those people.How many years have they been sounding same?
Before?..
Tinubu am sorry is leaving in 2031.Power has left core North for better Nigeria.
The north just want to be in power all the time.You may think they are interested in national progress, but they are not .They just want to remain in power as if they are the only tribe entitled to power in Nigeria.I am not a fan of Tinubu, but I wonder why these same people were silence when buhari was the president.The north will dare not stop the south from 2 terms.
I don't care if it is Tinubu or anyone, the south must complete 8 yrs in aso rock.
Is it your shege?, Amebo.You guys and your shabby calculations thoughThese are the same northern Christians you said can't get the votes for Tinubu is 2023 which you claim made Muslim Muslim desirableSuddenly they are the new bride?
How will the calculations make them give Tinubu victory this time around?
All these noisemakers, Tinubu doesn't make noise.

Going forward, we are determined to go around nooks and crannies of Lagos State to re-establish our drainage alignments in order to avoid flooding because whenever there is a flood in the state, you people will accuse the government of being irresponsible, he said.Wahab explained the illegal process in which shop owners/ traders had converted the setback of the drainage channels in the markets to stalls had impeded the free flow of stormwater and could lead to serious disease breakouts of Cholera, Diarrhea, typhoid fever, amongst others, saying if each and everyone make good sanitation practices a daily affair in their shops and environs, it would save the citizenry from continuous visit to the hospitals.With these illegal stalls and shops, if proper care is not taken, we can have a major disease outbreak, and these outbreaks can have negative impacts on our health care system, such that we would start undertaking various tests which we can avoid by doing the needful in every corner of our stalls he said.He recalled that the State Government had banned styrofoam over a year ago due to its adverse effects on human health and drainage channels.
He observed that some traders are still using and littering the market environment with the banned item and urged them to stop.I would like to appeal to our traders who still engage in selling styrofoams packs that we donTMt want to see styrofoams in our markets; it is obvious that some of you are still storing these styrofoams in your stores; It is high time you collaborate with the government as traders to help protect the environment and all the drainage alignments he stressed.Wahab emphasized that Global warming and climate change is real as such everyone must become responsible in order to push back the climate challenges and effects as much as possible.Let us make our choices now; markets are not meant to be sleeping places.
Stop building on the drainage alignment so that the drainages can remain clean always; the rains are coming, and we must be prepared, he added.During the tour,the Commissioner also ordered the immediate sealing of Kabaran Global NigeriaApogbon Truck Park on Adeniji Adele Road after the expiration of several abatement notices served, stressing that the contractor that would repair the major road is expected to move to the site and that the space had been allocated for the contractorTMs use.The Commissioner sounded a note of warning again to developers and residents who are fond of dumping building materials on the roads and drainage channels, thereby causing serious blockage to the natural flow of water, to desist from such acts while ordering the immediate sealing of a shopping complex under construction along Adeniji Adele Road.In an appreciation response, Alhaja Basirat Owolewa, who spoke on behalf of the Iyaloja of Gorodom Market, expressed appreciation to the government for opening up all blocked drainage channels in the market.She promised that traders in the market and around the re-established channel would be compelled to promote good sanitation practices and make it a priority from now on.

The 2 criminals all 5he way from.Onitsha cone dey rob for westThey are far away from home.
They are lucky because if they had been caught in Anambra, na barbecue straight.They will have their day in court, and death sentence by hanging maybe better than death sentence by barbecue-ing.
They are already dead meat.Any Igbo criminal comes to commit crime in Yorubaland will be shot dead.Not the first time.
Na because of this you enter night bus to SW?.
Yaribanzah criminals on the beat againdo you check the name mumu
They are lucky because if they had been caught in Anambra, na barbecue straight.They will have their day in court, and death sentence by hanging maybe better than death sentence by barbecue-ing.These ones won't be sent to court.
That's why they always make noise on Nairaland.
Before during and after independence, the Yorubas couldn't make it to the presidency but when they realigned, it was easy for them to make it to the presidency.

Anyway wey Peter Obi go Na dey I da goIrrespective of political party, except APC
I really hope say Asake dey make the right move sha.
But while we can't predict the future of Asake, we can predict the future of non-virgins a.k.a boreholes who did paternity fraud by taking your child for DNA test.What do I even know sef aside enlightening my fellow men nationwide with the good newsOga if you no meet your wife as a virgin, oga go for DNA test oooooooo because non-virgins aka boreholes can't be trusted atall atall

Na Dem.They are fond of killing each other.That was how they started killing each other because they were angry that Fulani men were attacking them.
Don't fall victim.Like bible talk am, be angry but sin not
Hot temper nor too good
Dem suppose leave one local government for PDP and Labour party to share na2027 election is gonna be a landslide for APC across the country.Oh Lord, may I never gather and labour in vain in my life.

Most of you don't know how to play to win.
Hello where are those obi will win 2027, oya come and analyse this?Una never sabi anything if obi manage to be in 6th position by 2027 election then he must go and do thanksgiving.When obi was building kwashoko bore holes in the North I was laughing even in the communities where he built those kwashoko borehole his party LP could not even secure ordinary Councillor seat talkless of LGA chairman.We will totally kill LP before 2027 to teach obi a bitter political lesson he refused to learn, he offended us and we will punish him to his grave so next time he will understand never to offend some people no matter how small they are.
GBV desk in Police divisions should not be make women saints who can do no evil, while portraying men as devils.This skewed approach we are copying from the West will only lead to more breakdowns of marriages and relationships between men and women

Abeg wetin amorin dey fear, how can u play a whole game without subbing knowing fully well the season is over already, he should play the academy what did he stand to lose for goodness sakeThe coach is just not smart and not suited to coach bigger clubs

infact thee gave Yoruba that name ..
Tinubu no send themEl Rufai na Tinubu baba, Losing him to the opposition will be catastrophic come 2027you means the same Kaduna that PDP won?
Politics mad shaDo not be an accessory to the roforofo fight between two politicians EXCEPT you have something to gain directly for either of them.
Going by your logic, it's safe to say that Sanwo-olu and even Tinubu are irrelevant and worked against themselves by supporting Obi, since they lost Lagos in a relatively free and fair election.
their Oga the bend down lick his shoes ..
If you keep people off-balance and in the dark, they canTMt counter your efforts2027 is not far walahi...una go chop bura-ubanka!
Tinubu no send themEl Rufai na Tinubu baba, Losing him to the opposition will be catastrophic come 2027bobloco u are what should b called agba muguTinubu is wise n strategic, he's fighting el rufai through proxy.
Like he will send people to ridicule him n disgrace him but he will keep praising him.After el rufai has been rubished n disgraced thoroughly n he has almost been reduced to nothing then tinubu will come to his rescue n b d boss againIt's cheese game but d mugu u don't understand d game but u believe el rufai na tinubu baba, same el rufai that has been reduced to a blogger

HeTMs very strategic when it comes to playing politics.He might not be performing at the expectations of many Nigerians but you see the game called Nigerian politics, leave it to president Tinubu.He taught me about PATIENCE, but when it gets to YOUR TURN , make sure you GRAB IT by all means and RUN WITH IT.No one is ready to give you whatTMs yours if you donTMt take it forcefully.
Fergie..No dey delete my posts ..See those Yoruba monikers ..
you no deleteTo call Yoruba by their name na crime?Stop being biaseIgbos wey dem dey insult daily for the forum you no even delete those post demWake and stop being tribal
So make Tinubu go flog his Nephew or draw his ears?
Mr Governor..Obey court order na"It is very clear that no consequential order was made because the APP case is still subsisting.
Politics na ya mate  ?
Abi you can ask Pastor Adeboye when he goes visit his University, is he not happy with the road leading to the place, although I have not being to Ifewara I am sure the road if not done would be done .
I bet Alhaji sef would come and put more investment here soon .
The Dancing Governor is a shinning light to all, we all know even though the economy is biting we are still for you Mr President, talk to your Nephew o, by the way he has been opening dry port everywhere, opening port everywhere, Biko tell him to jump start the one in Ondo as well as open a dry port in Osun even if he wants to put it in Iragbiji na him sabi ...Hope you are still enjoying your vacation in France buy cake come o ..
Despite say you be Governor, you still dey chase clout.Abeg, park well ooo and brace up cos 2026 is already here ooo.You better start practicing dance steps for campaign before dey go carry you goal-goal
Which kain yeye Governor be this?
Demola no get sense honestly
The Governor is somehow cheeky for reminding us that they are nephews, it has a political undertoneWell, I have seen children that are way older than their step fathers or step mothers.Some uncles sef are same age as their nephews or nieces.Dem full everywhere.
You too deploy amotekun and your thug alowonle,( abi wetin be in name sef )to counter them.
These state electoral commissions just dey write results for governors.
I don't usually do this, but i just need to clarify the possibility with a personal example
Though I don't like you - I totally dislike the nsogbu-nsogbu blood in you - but the APC is an evil party that must be destroyed by every well meaning Nigerian!
All of us dey go that way...that's the beauty of it all
Obi is always excited by the news of death.The last time I read about him, he was at a funeral somewhere.You never see him at weddings.Obi no dey to where celebration dey.Yes it makes sense, that way he can always be in the news so you can get bittered and cry everyday just like you are doing now.

When I tell you Clowns that these men you fight over are not enemies, una think say I dey misyarn.They are all wealthy, highly placed, and well connected.They all have easy access to the best of Nigeria's resources.You people are here fighting and abusing yourselves on their behalf while they and their children are wining and sharing Nigeria's wealth among themselves.Una never wan get sense.

Their activities, I dare say, are nefarious.With the recent revelations linking an Anambra lawmakerTMs murder to Asaba-based native doctors and shrines, it is clear that they are not just supporting  Yahoo YahooTM fraudsters but are also involved in kidnappings.
Asagba was being diplomatic not to mention names but no wahala..
If Soludo could be putting fire under their yansh in Anambra, why won't the same be done in Delta where they are running to hide.
Asagba was being diplomatic not to mention names but no wahala..

Wetin we knowCongratulations to Igboland..More blessings and grace as your leaders truly seek the mercy of God.The monarch emphasised that many of these practitioners are not of Asaba origin and have taken over the land with criminal motives.Mr Land grabber, I hope you can read what the Monarch was saying here.

you don see me open threads about oyo, oshun , ekiti etc dey Dey cry?
And we know those he was talking about.look at his first statement " Igbo are sanctifying their land" asaba in delta no be them own.
No wonder ikwere prevents Igbo from holding Igbo day meeting in river state, and asked them to do it in IMO or any eastern state.
Them just dey run come here to enjoy freedom, security, wey them destroy finally for east since when ipob enter there and wey we reject  this way.ezrwanyi juju women run come here since when soludo restrict them in Anambra
