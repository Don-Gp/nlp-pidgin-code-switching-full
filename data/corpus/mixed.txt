<pidgin>Pep Guardiola and im Manchester City side avoid wetin for be ogbonge embarrassment as dem manage to beat Club Brugge 3-1 for dia last match for di league phase of dis year Uefa Champions League.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis win help City finish 22 for di league table, just two places above di last qualification position, as dem manage to qualify for di play off stage to see weda dem fit reach di round of 16.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Guardiola boys manage only a disappointing 11 points wit only three wins and three draws for dia eight matches of di Champions League first round.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Meanwhile, Arne Slot and im Liverpool team finish on top of di league even though dem lose dia final match 3-2 against PSV Eindhoven for di Netherlands.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Barcelona 2-2 draw wit Atalanta mean say di Nou Camp side no fit take advantage of Liverpool loss to jump into first position; di Spanish giants finish second.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Arsenal also qualify automatically for di round of 16 after dem beat Girona 2-1 for Spain to finish third on di table.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di same tin wit Aston Villa who beat Celtic 3-2 for Villa Park to occupy di last qualification position of eighth.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Altogether, three English teams, two Spanish, and one team each from Italy, Germany and France make am into di top eight wey be di automatic qualification position for di round of 16.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E shock many pipo say big names like Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, PSG, Manchester City, and AC Milan no qualify automatically.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Below na how di league phase of di new Champions League format take</pidgin>
<pidgin>First, make we remind ourself of wetin di 36 league-phase teams dey aim for.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Those wey finish for di top eight go automatically progress to di last 16, wia dem go seed dem.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem go wait for di winners of di eight two-legged knockout play-off ties wey go feature di clubs wey rank from ninth to 24th.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Those wey finish between ninth and 16th dem go seed dem and dem go face teams wey dey placed 17th to 24th, wit di advantage of playing di second leg at home.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di clubs 25th or lower don chop elimination and dem no go get entry to di Europa League.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di play-off ties go take place mid-February, while di last-16 matches go happun for di first two weeks of March.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One of Uefa reasons for changing to dis format na to make ""every game count"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem say di format ""go ensure say any result get di potential to dramatically change a team position, right up to and including di very last matchday"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>And so, e don play out wit only two dead rubbers (Sturm Graz v Leipzig and Young Boys v Red Star Belgrade) and 16 games wit something on di line.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E get several games wia both clubs dey battle for di same goal, like Manchester City v Club Brugge, Stuttgart v PSG, Brest v Real Madrid and Inter Milan v Monaco.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E fit lead to enjoyable mayhem for fans wit some teams potentially wey go dey affected by more dan 10 oda games.</pidgin> <pidgin>Aston Villa, for example, fit overtake six teams or 15 teams fit overtake dem (although not all 15) - including opponents Celtic.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Another reason Uefa give for the new format na to ensure more matches between di top teams in di initial stages of di tournament.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis year don see Real Madrid face Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool in repeats of three recent finals, and Barcelona play Bayern Munich, while Paris St-Germain don face Arsenal, Atletico Madrid, Bayern Munich and Manchester City.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Failing to qualify for di next round go hit teams financially.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Every club for di league phase go get 18.62m euros for participating, wit performance bonuses of 2.1m euros per win and 700,000 euros per draw.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Each position for di table dey worth 275,000 euros, too.</pidgin> <pidgin>So di team wey finish 36th earn dis much, 35th go claim 550,000 euros through to 9.9m euros for di table-toppers.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Teams wey finish first to eighth also go earn 2m euros bonus, while teams wey finish ninth to 16th go get 1m euros.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Uefa also introduce a ""value pillar"" wey go split di broadcast revenue.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis again go increase depending on your finishing position for di league phase.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dat na bifor dem take into account matchday revenue and oda factors.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In oda words, e dey costly to chop elimination early."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Further south in Malawi, USAID-funded activities also don stop.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Macro Mzuzu Clinic, a key provider of HIV services for di kontri northern region, di gates dey shut.</pidgin> <pidgin>Vehicles dey idle.</pidgin> <english>No sign of activity.</english>
<pidgin>According to local resident Eddah Simfukwe Banda, wey dey depend on di clinic for her antiretroviral treatment, di clinic don dey deserted since dem issue di stop-work order.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even afta di US State Department issue a waiver on 28 January to allow di delivery of medicine such as ARVs, many clinics still remain closed.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Witout di critical staff wey dey coordinate USAID activities, distributing medicines don become a challenge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even wia services technically dey permitted to resume, many contracts remain uncertain.</pidgin> <pidgin>Health workers dey unsure of wetin dem fit and fit no do.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Trump administration plan to significantly reduce USAID staff by more dan 90%.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Atul Gawande, USAID former Global Health Assistant Administrator, post on X say di agency workforce go dey slashed from 14,000 to 294wit only 12 staff assigned to Africa.</pidgin>
<pidgin>More dan 30 NGOs also dey severely impacted by di funding freeze.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Malawi receive $154 million from USAID health budget for 2023, wey make dem di 10th largest recipient for Africa.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di kontri remain one of di poorest and most aid-dependent in di world.</pidgin> <pidgin>According to di World Bank, Malawi dey vulnerable to external shocksincluding prolonged droughts, cyclones, and erratic rainfall.</pidgin> <pidgin>Disruption of dis magnitude for dia healthcare system present an ogbonge challenge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Eddah Simfukwe Banda dey worried about her own fateand dat of her sister-in-law, wey also dey rely on donor-funded medication.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""As pipo wey dey on ART treatment we get several options to dis case.</pidgin> <english>One we get to pray as Malawians.</english> <pidgin>Dose of us wey believe and depend on God say we get God wey dey open doors wen one dey closed,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Right to Care, anoda USAID-funded health provider, dey forced to suspend most of dia operations, including dia HIV outreach programs for LGBTQ+ individuals for northern Malawi.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One staff member describe di facility as ""semi-deserted,"" wit only a handful of personnel allowed through a small walk-in gate.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to UNAIDS, di global outlook dey grim.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For 2023, e bin get 630,000 AIDS-related deaths worldwide and 1.5 million new infections.</pidgin>
<pidgin>While infection rates don dey decline in di worst-affected kontris, di impact of di USAID shutdown fit reverse dis gains.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""If you take away dis major contribution by di United States goment, we expect say in di next five years, additional 6.3 million AIDS-related deaths go dey,"" UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima tell BBC Africa Daily podcast.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""8.7 million new infections go dey, 3.4 million additional AIDS orphans go dey.</pidgin> <pidgin>I no wan sound like a prophet of doom, but I get a duty to give di facts as we see dem.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>One major concern for health experts na drug resistance.</pidgin> <pidgin>According to Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF), any interruption in HIV treatment fit get severe consequences.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Any interruption to HIV services and treatment dey deeply distressing to pipo wey dey care and emergency wen e comes to HIV treatment,"" na so Tom Ellman, director of di South Africa Medical Unit at MSF Southern Africa tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""HIV medicines gatz dey taken daily or pipo go run di risk of developing resistance or deadly health complications.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Byanyima echo dis concerns, sharing di words of a desperate</pidgin>
<pidgin>""One pesin living wit HIV don describe am as, 'Di na death trap.</pidgin> <pidgin>Please tok to di American goment.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis na death trap for us.</pidgin> <pidgin>If I no get my tablets next month and di following month, how much longer I get to live?'""</pidgin>
<pidgin>For decades, di US na im be Africa most significant public health partner.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Since di launch for 2003, di US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) don save more dan 25 million lives.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""In di past year, USAID give $8 billion of aid assistance to Africa.</pidgin> <pidgin>Seventy-three percent go to healthcare,"" Africa CDC Director General Jean Kaseya tell di BBC Newsday program on 29 January.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Health experts warn say replacing dis funding go dey extremely difficult.</pidgin>
<pidgin>African goments don make strides in reducing aid dependency.</pidgin> <pidgin>Kenya now dey fund nearly 60% of dia HIV response.</pidgin> <pidgin>South Africa dey cova almost 80%.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But for many low-income nations, debt burdens, climate disasters, and economic shocks dey make self-sufficiency nearly impossible.</pidgin>
<english>Amref Health Africa CEO, Dr.</english> <pidgin>Githinji Gitahi, warn say witout urgent action, global health security dey at risk.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Dis go require African goments and Africa CDC to increase dia own funding, wey dey almost impossible under di current debt distress conditions,"" e tok.</pidgin>

<pidgin>''Di first time I see my daughter face, I forget all my pregnancy pain,"" Kinjal Lathi, from Ahmedabad in India tok.</pidgin>
<english>""I cry, and also my husband.""</english>
<pidgin>Until dat moment marriage and motherhood dey always feel like a distant dream for Kinjal becos she get beta thalassaemia major disease.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She need a blood transfusion evri two weeks and gatz follow a veri strict diet and medicine regime.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Added to her underlying health condition na di challenge to born a child in di first place and to carry am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E get risks for both mother and child wey dey involved.</pidgin> <pidgin>But I decide to realise my motherhood dream,'' Kinjal tok.</pidgin>
<english>Kinjal do 36 blood transfusions during her pregnancy but eventually give birth to a healthy daughter on July 12 for 2019.</english> <pidgin>She get a planned caesarean section birth wey dey designed to minimise any potential blood loss.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even afta she give birth, di 25 year-old ""gatz undergo blood transfusion,"" she tok.</pidgin> <pidgin>She add say at one point she do transfusion and at di same time she dey breastfeed her newborn baby</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di blood disorder no dey inherited by her daughter.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Thalassaemia dey caused by faulty genes wey dey affect di production of haemoglobin wey be di protein for red blood cells wey dey carry oxygen around di body.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pikin fit only dey born wit thalassaemia if dem inherit dis faulty genes from both parents.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So, if both parents get di faulty gene wey dey cause beta thalassaemia major, e get a one in four chance of each child say dem go dey born wit di condition.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Parents of a child wit thalassaemia na usually carriers, meaning say dem only get one of di faulty genes.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Kinjal successful pregnancy dey extremely rare, according to paediatrician Doctor Anil Khatri, member of di Gujarat State thalassaemia task force.</pidgin> <pidgin>E treat both mother and child.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So rare, in fact, na somtin wey im neva previously encounter for di last three decades as a doctor treating more dan 100 thalassaemia patients.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Worldwide e get around 270 million pipo wey get thalassaemia, according to di Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na devastating disease wey dey make patients weak, get short of breath, unable to work and cut dia life expectancy.</pidgin>
<english>E get several different types of thalassaemia, including Hemoglobin H disease.</english>
<pidgin>Dis fit dey divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias - beta thalassaemia major (TM) na di most severe version of di disorder, India get 100,000 -150,000 children wit TM, di highest number of cases for di world.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Some 10,000-15,000 Indian babies dey born wit di disease evri year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>To give birth to a baby in di first place dey harder for pipo wit thalassaemia, gynaecologist Doctor Uma Khatri, wey treat Kinjal, explain.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Repeated blood transfusions fit affect di hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenaline glands and secretion of hormones wey dey impact fertility.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Correctly balancing iron levels through transfusions also dey challenging and patients fit also end up wit too much iron circulating for dia blood.</pidgin>
<pidgin>During pregnancy, di volume of blood for your body increase and so also di amount of iron wey you need to support yourself and supply oxygen to your baby.</pidgin> <pidgin>""Thalassaemia patients don increase iron due to repeated blood transfusions.</pidgin> <pidgin>Den normally dey take medicine to reduce dis but dem no fit give am during pregnancy as e fit affect di patient internal organs,'' Doctor Uma Khatri explain.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Usually, we dey call pregnant women for a check-up once a month.</pidgin> <pidgin>We dey call Kinjal evri 15 days.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis na first-time for us too,"" Khatri tok as she explain say sonography normally na monthly to monitor a baby growth during pregnancy.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Sake of di additional strain pregnancy fit put on Kinjal body, her husband Naveen Lathia dey understandably worried.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say e dey ""afraid im go lose Kinjal for di process."" But following her insistence, despite di risks, she still wan get a baby so e begin to research.</pidgin> <pidgin>E no dey able to find a single oda case of a woman wit thalassaemia major giving birth to a healthy child.</pidgin> <pidgin>""But afta I discuss am wit di doctor, I dey ready,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta di birth, doctors advise Kinjal to stick to home-cooked food and stay away from crowded places to reduce any risk of infection.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Khatri say TM patients dey at higher risk of infection as dia vital organs like heart, kidneys, lungs fit don damage and weaken dia immune response.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pre-marital testing of couples and pregnant women plus counselling sessions don become widespread across India wit millions wey dey take part.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Anil Khatri advise Indian couples say bifor any marriage both partners gatz dey tested for genetic blood disorders.</pidgin> <pidgin>""If both get thalassaemia minor, make dem avoid marriage if possible, as e mean say e get a one in four chance of dat couple to get thalassemia major pikin,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, doctors advise say if couple wey dey expect pikin both get thalassemia minor, a prenatal test fit take place for utero - wen di foetus still dey for di mother womb - at eight to nine weeks old.</pidgin>
<pidgin>If dat test den show say di pikin go get thalassaemia major, den some couples fit choose to do medical abortion."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Marcus Rashford na one of di popular players for Premier League.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im don make 426 appearances for Manchester United and im dey 12th for di club all-time scoring list wit 138 goals.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di 27-year-old don win both di FA Cup and EFL Cup twice.</pidgin> <pidgin>Im also don win di Europa League.</pidgin> <pidgin>Im get 60 England caps.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Outside football, dem award am MBE for 2021 for im work around child poverty.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But now im career get as e be sake of tori wey dey fly up and down say im days for United dey numbered afta im coach drop am for di Manchester derby.</pidgin>
<pidgin>On 18 July 2023 United confam say Rashford don sign new contract wey go keep am for di club until 30 June 2028.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis end all di tok-tok about im future as Rashford previous deal bin dey due to expire in 12 months and im already don dey linked wit a number of major European clubs.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di move make sense.</pidgin> <pidgin>Rashford bin just score a career-best 30 domestic goals during di 2022-23 season and im still only be 25.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta three games witout a goal, im score di opener for wetin turn out to be a 3-1 defeat for Arsenal on 3 September.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im no score again for anoda 13 games as United poor form under Erik ten Hag begin.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For January di coach drop Rashford for dia FA Cup trip to Newport County afta e miss training sake of illness afta im bin spend longer time pass wetin dem approve for am for one authorised trip to Belfast.</pidgin> <pidgin>Foto comot of am wia im dey enter nightclub wia im bin drink tequila.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Although Rashford score di first goal of Ruben Amorim reign afta only 81 seconds for Ipswich on 24 November, di new United head coach don admit say di central striker no be di 27-year-old best position.</pidgin> <pidgin>Although Rashford bin start three games and be substitute for three of Amorim first six games in charge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But, crucially, im bin dey bench for di midweek Premier League trip to Arsenal and di home game wey follow against Nottingham Forest on 7 December.</pidgin> <pidgin>Im start for di Europa League against Vitoria Plzen on 12 December but dem replace am afta 56 minutes wen United dey 1-0 down.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dem go on to win 2-1.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem drop am along wit Alejandro Garnacho for di Manchester derby.</pidgin> <pidgin>Afta di game, Amorim explain ""Di performance for training, di way you eat, di way you push your team-mates - evritin dey important for di beginning of somtin.</pidgin> <pidgin>Wen pipo for your club dey lose dia jobs, we gatz put di standards really high.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>At some point, evri manager get to make big calls.</pidgin> <pidgin>weda you like am or not, di outcome go end up to be how pipo see am .</pidgin>
<pidgin>Sir Alex Ferguson time for United dey littered wit major decisions - from axing Paul McGrath and Norman Whiteside but keeping Bryan Robson for di start of im reign, to letting Paul Pogba leave at di end.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Amorim know exactly wetin di fallout go be from im decision to leave Rashford out.</pidgin>
<pidgin>If United bin lose for Manchester City, pipo for ask many questions about di wisdom of just having only Joshua Zirkzee for bench as attacking player.</pidgin> <pidgin>But dem no need to.</pidgin> <pidgin>Thanks to Amad Diallo, dem win.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Today we prove say we fit leave anybodi out and win,"" Amorim tok afterwards.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dat na big stick to take beat im players.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rashford na realist.</pidgin> <pidgin>Im go know di hand writing for wall for am.</pidgin> <pidgin>E dey fair to say for di past 18 months - or for all but di 2022-23 season since November 2021 im score only twice for im last 28 appearances of di campaign wey Ralf Rangnick end in charge - im form dey below di standards of wetin im dey capable of.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Many pipo don criticise am well-well for im work ethic - and by some for im off-field behaviour, wey include trip to United States during di November international break.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Although some pipo dey argue say di way dem dey single out Rashford no fair.</pidgin> <pidgin>But dat side of im life no go change.</pidgin> <pidgin>Im need to deliver - and many times, im no dey deliver.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rashford na one of United highest earners, im basic wage reach 300,000 a week.</pidgin> <pidgin>Only a small number of clubs fit afford dat salary and, for a variety of reasons, some of dem no dey market.</pidgin>
<english>For Spain, evribodi know Barcelona financial issues.</english> <pidgin>Real Madrid already struggle to find di right attacking combination from Kylian Mbappe, Vinicius Jr and Jude Bellingham.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Atletico bin pay big money to Manchester City for Julian Alvarez just bifor di summer transfer deadline.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For England top clubs, Manchester City and Liverpool na a bit of a stretch, even wit City poor form.</pidgin> <pidgin>Arsenal need a central striker - and Rashford no like to play dia.</pidgin> <pidgin>Chelsea dey like dem don spend enough.</pidgin> <pidgin>Tottenham dey inconsistent but e dey hardly likely for dem to drop dia skipper Son Heung-min, wey dey play for left.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Many times pipo don mention Paris St-Germain as a possible destination on a number of occasions down di years, but di French giants don always comot dia bodi from dat kain tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>United don previously dey linked wit Randal Kolo Muani.</pidgin> <pidgin>However, even a swap deal dey questionable sake of say Rasmus Hojlund don impress as Amorim first choice for di lead attacking role.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Saudi Pro League fit make a big statement by signing such a recognisable figure from di Premier League wey be 27years.</pidgin> <pidgin>However, di feeling na say Rashford no buy dat kain plan.</pidgin>
<pidgin>A loan involving some kain wage contribution dey possible.</pidgin> <pidgin>But United don repeatedly speak of dia tight profit and sustainability rules (PSR) situation, as well as dia commitment to abide by di rules, so paying to let a high earner play for someone else go dey counter-productive.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Anybodi wey dey old enough to remember di Wayne Rooney saga from October 2010, wen im drop in a transfer request, wey Ferguson publicly finish am.</pidgin> <pidgin>And den go on to sign a new contract, all within less dan a week, go know say notin dey impossible for United.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis mata get three main points.</pidgin>
<pidgin>First one, na weda Rashford go meet Amorim demands?</pidgin> <pidgin>Dat, really, go be di easy bit - certainly di effort suppose dey non-negotiable.</pidgin> <pidgin>I dey tok about di effort Amorim dey demand, no be wetin di social media observers tink.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Second one, na if, im go fit di system?</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis part dey a bit more tricky.</pidgin> <english>Rashford like to play wide and cut in.</english> <pidgin>But no slot for dat for Amorim system.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di coach don already tok say Rashford no dey ideally suited for a typical number nine role, wey go leave am wit either wing back (unlikely) or inside forward.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di inside forward go require a lot of work, wey United no get wit dia current schedule.</pidgin> <pidgin>But if Hojlund dey hold di ball up, using Rashford pace to run na a viable alternative.</pidgin>
<pidgin>If Amorim want im team to dominate possession, e dey less valuable, especially if dem dey move into a higher area for pitch on a more consistent basis.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di third option na to accept make di team dey use am as impact substitute.</pidgin> <pidgin>As Rashford dey approach di peak point of im career, going down dat route dey difficult to see am happun."</pidgin>

<pidgin>""Abeg help us,"" na di message wey dem write on piece of paper wey two girls hold up through di window of one room for di luxury Decpolis hotel for Panama City.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di hotel offer dia clients rooms wit sea views, e get two exclusive restaurants, swimming pool, spa and private transportation.</pidgin> <pidgin>But di hotel don become ""temporary custody"" centre wey dey house 299 migrants wey dem deport from di US, di Panamanian goment tok on Tuesday.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Some migrants raise dia arms and cross dem at di wrists to show say dem dey deprive dem of dia freedom.</pidgin> <pidgin>Odas hang small sign wit messages such ""We no dey safe in our kontri.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis migrants, dey part of di undocumented pipo wey Trump administration deport from di US, dem arrive for Panama on three flights last week.</pidgin>
<pidgin>President Jos Ral Mulino recently agree say Panama go become di ""bridge"" kontri for deportees wey dem force to comot from US.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Howeva, di 299 migrants - from India, China, Uzbekistan, Iran, Vietnam, Turkey, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka - only 171 don agree to return to dia kontris of origin.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di remainder dey face more uncertain future.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to di Panamanian goment, dem go transfer dis group to camp in di province of Darin, wey don temporarily house migrants wey dey cross di jungle to di US.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Bifor tourists fit enta and leave di hotel wit ease, but now heavily armed members of di Panamanian National Aeronaval Service don enforce strict security measures inside and outside di building.</pidgin>
<pidgin>From di street, pipo dey hang di clothes wey dem wash for window.</pidgin> <pidgin>One of di items na yellow Lakers basketball jersey wit di number 24, wey legendary player Kobe Bryant don wear.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For anoda window, one group of adults and three children don raise dia arms wit dia thumbs for dia palms - di international symbol for pipo wey need assistance.</pidgin> <pidgin>""Help us,"" dem write am in red letters on di glass.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Two minors wey cover dia faces hold up sheets of paper against di glass wit di ""Abeg save di Afghan girls.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>One Iranian woman wey dey live for Panama for some years tell di BBC say she dey in contact wit one of di migrants wey dey inside di hotel and dem dey ""fear"" say dem fit return to Iran.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She tok say wen she enta di hotel to offer help as Farsi translator, dem tok say dem don already help dem, although according to sources wey dey inside di hotel, e no be true, she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Using hidden mobile phone, since di contact wit pipo wey dey outside of di Decpolis hotel reportedly no dey allowed, di Iranian woman tok say migrant tell her say ""several minors dey trapped"" for di hotel, wey dem don deny lawyer and dem no allow dem to comot from dia rooms even to go chop.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta di media first report di story of di deportees on Tuesday, security measures put in place dey tight and dem don cut migrants access to di internet, di Iranian woman tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di BBC contact both di Decpolis hotel and di Panamanian goment to inquire about di conditions wey dem hold di migrants down, but dem neva send any respons.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Howeva, di Minister of Public Security of Panama Frank brego tok say migrants no dey allowed to comot from di hotel say im goment must guarantee di safety and peace of di Panamanians.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Video wey dem post on social media on di weekend show one of di migrants wey describe for Farsi how dem detain dem afta dem cross di border to di US and tell dem say dem go take dem to Texas, but end up in Panama.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di woman in di video insist say dia lives dey in danger if dem return to Iran becos of possible attack of di goment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Her intention, she tok say, na to seek political asylum.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Analysts say dis go dey difficult to obtain witout access to lawyer - even more so wen di Panamanian goment don announce dem no go offer di access to deportees.</pidgin>
<pidgin>On Tuesday, brego say di migrants go remain temporarily for Panama unda di protection of di kontri authorities.</pidgin>

<pidgin>South Africa President Cyril Ramaphosa don tok to Elon Musk to try to settle di quarrel wit di new US administration ova one new land law.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Oga Musk na close adviser to US President Donald Trump, on Sunday Trump threaten to cut all future funding to South Africa ova allegations say dem dey collect land and ""dem dey treat certain classes of pipo very badly"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di South Africa-born tech billionaire put mouth for di quarrel wen im ask on X why Ramaphosa get ""open racist ownership laws"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ramaphosa office say for di call to Oga Musk di president ""reemphasize South Africa constitutional values wey torchlight di respect for di rule of law, justice, fairness and equality"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa sign into law one bill wey go allow land seizures without compensation for certain circumstances.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Land ownership mata na long and serious issue for South Africa, most private farmland na white pipo get am, 30 years afta di end of di racist system of apartheid.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Many pipo don tell di goment to address di land reform and deal wit di past injustices of racial segregation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For im earlier response to Trump, di South Africa president say im ""goment no kolobi any land"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>On Sunday, Trump write on im social media platform Truth ""I go cut off all future funding to South Africa until di full investigation of dis situation complete!""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im later tok, for one briefing wit tori pipo say, South Africa ""leadership dey do some terrible tins, horrible tins"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>""So dat dey under investigation right now.</pidgin> <pidgin>We go decide, and until such time wen we find out wetin South Africa dey do  dem dey take land and kolobi land, and actually dem dey do things wey perhaps dey far worse dan that.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>South Africa new law allow for expropriation dat one mean to seize without compensation only in circumstances wia e dey ""just and equitable and e dey in di public interest"" to do so.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis include if di property dem no dey use am and dem no get any intention to either develop am or make money from am, or when e dey pose risk to di pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For more dan a century land ownership na very big issue for South Africa.</pidgin> <pidgin>For 1913, British colonial authorities bin pass law wey restrict di property rights of black pipo wey be majority for di kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Natives Land Act bin leave vast majority of di land under di control of di white minority and set di foundation for di forced removal of black pipo to poor homelands and townships for decades until di end of apartheid three decades ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Anger ova these forced removals intensify di fight against white-minority rule.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For 1994, leader of di African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela become di kontri first democratically elected president afta all South Africans get di right to vote.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But until di recently passed law, goment bin only fit buy land from dia current owners under di principle of ""willing seller, willing buyer"", wey some pipo feel say don delay di process of land reform.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For 2017, one goment report say di farmland wey dey di hands of private individuals, 72% na white-pipo get am.</pidgin> <pidgin>According to di 2022 census white pipo make up 7.3% of di population.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, some critics dey fear say di new land law fit get disastrous consequences like e happun for Zimbabwe, wia seizures wreck di economy and scare away investors."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Di mineral-rich east of di Democratic Republic of Congo don dey affected by conflict for more dan 30 years, since di 1994 Rwandan genocide.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Plenty armed groups don compete wit di central authorities to gain power and control of di potential fortune for dis vast nation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di instability affect neighbouring kontris well-well for di 1990s wen two huge conflicts, wey dem call Africa World Wars, lead to di death of millions of pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta one rapid advance for di region, fighters from di M23 rebel group don take control of most part of Goma  one major city of more dan one million pipo for di east of DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Goma, wey lie for di foot of one volcano near Lake Kivu, dey share border wit Rwanda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Goma na di capital of mineral-rich North Kivu province - and na important trading and transport hub wey dey close to mining towns wey dey supply metals and minerals in high demand like gold, tin and coltan, wey be key component of mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Goma also na di base for di UN largest peacekeeping mission.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di city don also become safe place for pipo wey dey run from di fight-fight between M23 fighters and di army wey start again for late 2021  as di population don increase to around two million.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di rebels tok say dem dey control di city, although reports dey say dem still dey face small-small resistance.</pidgin>
<pidgin>UN aid agencies don warn of major humanitarian crisis, as casualties don full hospitals and bodies lie down for streets.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ethnic Tutsis na dem dey lead di M23.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dem say dem need arms to protect di minority group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di rebels tok say most of di previous deals to end di fighting no dey respected  Di group get dia name from one peace agreement wey dem sign on 23 March 2009.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shortly afta dia creation for 2012, di M23 bin rapidly gain territory and seize Goma  actions wey receive international condemnations and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem force dem to withdraw from Goma, and dem suffer series of heavy defeats for di hands of di Congolese army plus one UN force wey ensure say dem force dem comot di kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>M23 fighters later agreed join di army but wit promises say Tutsis go dey protected.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But for 2021, di group bin take up arms again, as dem say goment break and no honour di promises.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Neighbouring Rwanda in di past don consistently deny say dem dey support M23, but for 2012, UN experts bin accuse Rwanda of providing weapons, logistical support and say na dem even dey command di rebels.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo goment, di US and France, don also identify say Rwanda dey back di group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Last year, one UN experts report tok say up to 4,000 Rwandan troops dey fight alongside di M23.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For inside one statement on Sunday, Rwanda no openly deny say dem dey back M23, but instead dem say di fighting wey dey near dia border na ""serious threat"" to dia ""security and territorial integrity"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda add say pipo dey use di kontri as scapegoat as dem blame di recent fighting on di Congolese authorities, dem say di authorities don refuse to dialogue wit di M23.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One peace process, wey Angola facilitate wey involve Rwanda and DR Congo, bin result inside ceasefire deal last year, however e no last and di fighting start again.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem fit partly trace di origin of di current fighting back to di genocide for Rwanda for 1994.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ethnic Hutu extremists bin kill about 800,000 pipo majority of dem from di Tutsi community.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di genocide bin end wit di advance of one force of Tutsi-led rebels wey Paul Kagame, who be di president now bin command.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Fearing retaliations, an estimate of about one million Hutus bin run across di border to wetin now be DR Congo.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis fuel ethnic tensions as one marginalised Tutsi group for di east  di Banyamulenge  bin feel increasingly under threat.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda army invade DR Congo two times, dem tok say dem dey go afta some of those wey dey responsible for di genocide.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dem work wit members of di Banyamulenge plus oda armed groups.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta 30 years of conflict, one of di Hutu groups, di Democratic Forces for di Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), wey include some of those wey dey responsible for di Rwandan genocide, still dey active for eastern DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda describe di FDLR as ""genocidal militia"" and dem say dia continued existence for DR Congo east na threat to dia own territory.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem accuse di Congolese authorities of working wit di FDLR  accuse wey DR Congo deny.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda no go stay out of DR Congo unless dem dey very sure say FDLR no be threat to dia kontri again, or to di Tutsi communities for eastern DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo and multiple UN reports don accuse Rwanda say dem dey use di conflict as way to loot Congolese minerals, like gold and coltan.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dem dey use dis minerals to make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In recent years, di M23 don seize several lucrative mining areas and one report by UN experts last December tok say, M23 dey send around 120 tonnes of coltan to Rwanda every four weeks.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem also note huge rise for Rwanda mineral exports in recent years, most of which dem believe come from DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda consistently don deny allegations say dem dey exploit DR Congo minerals.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One UN peacekeeping mission don dey in place since 1999.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di current force  known as Monusco  dey made up of more dan 10,000 troops.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, out of these, na only di Force Intervention Brigade dey allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups.</pidgin> <pidgin>Na dis force help defeat M23 for 2013.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Monusco don become di target of anger from ordinary Congolese wey dey see dem as say dem dey fail for dia job.</pidgin>
<pidgin>President Flix Tshisekedi, wey reason di mission as a failure, bin ask dem to leave by di end of last year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But dem no go for December and dem extend di mission for anoda one year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Southern African Development Community (Sadc), one regional grouping of 16 kontris don also send one military force to eastern DR Congo, but dem still no fit stop di rebels.</pidgin>
<pidgin>South Africa tok say 13 of dia sojas don die for di clashes wit rebels as dem dey try stop di advance on Goma.</pidgin> <pidgin>Three Malawian sojas also don die.</pidgin>
<pidgin>UN tok say Uruguay also lost one of dia sojas wey be part of di Monusco force.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Congolese President Flix Tshisekedi don vow to restore goment authority for di east, where Rwanda-backed M23 rebels don seize most part of di city of Goma and dey reportedly advance south to seize more territory.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For one televised address to di nation, e say ""vigorous and coordinated response"" against wetin e call ""terrorists"" dey under way.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E condemn di international community for ""inaction"" and say dem no do enough in di wake of di escalating security crisis.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di weeks-long offensive by di rebels don prompt warnings of a looming humanitarian crisis and growing international pressure to end di crisis.</pidgin>
<pidgin>During Wednesday night address, Tshisekedi bin ask all Congolese to join together and support di army fight to retake control.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Be sure of one di Democratic Republic of Congo no go allow itself to dey humiliated or crushed.</pidgin> <pidgin>We go fight and we go win,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di fighting don force about 500,000 pipo to run comot dia homes, and e don worsen di already serious humanitarian crisis for di kontri, according to di UN.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Since di fighting start, electricity no dey di city again, water and food also dey very scarce.</pidgin>

<pidgin>Egyptologists don discover di first tomb of a pharaoh since dem uncover Tutankhamun own over a century ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>King Thutmose II tomb na di last undiscovered royal tomb of di 18th Egyptian dynasty.</pidgin>

<pidgin>""Di emotion of getting into dis tins na just one of extraordinary confusion becos wen you come across something wey you no expect to find, e dey emotional really,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""And wen I come out, my wife bin dey wait outside and di only thing I fit do na to burst into tears.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Litherland say di discovery don solve di mystery of wia di tombs of early 18th dynasty kings dey located.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Researchers find Thutmose II mummified remains two centuries ago but di original burial site bin never dey located.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Thutmose II na ancestor of Tutankhamun, wey im reign dey believed to dey from about 1493 to 1479 BC.</pidgin> <english>British archaeologists find Tutankhamun tomb for 1922.</english>
<pidgin>Thutmose II dey best known for being di husband of Queen Hatshepsut, regarded as one of Egypt greatest pharaohs and one of di few female pharaohs wey rule in her own right.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Litherland say di ""large staircase and a very large descending corridor"" of di tomb suggest grandeur.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E take us a very long time to get through all dat,"" e tok, noting say e bin dey blocked by flood, dirty and di ceilings bin don collapse.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Na only after we crawl through 10m (32ft) passageway wey get small 40cm gap at di top na im we get into di burial chamber.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na dia dem discover di blue ceiling and decorations of scenes from di Amduat, religious text wey dey reserved for kings.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dat na anoda key sign say dem don find a king tomb, Dr Litherland tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem set to work clearing di dirty dem - expecting say dem go find di crushed remains of a burial underneath.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But ""di tomb turn out to dey completely empty"", Dr Litherland tok.</pidgin> <pidgin>""Not becos e dey robbed but becos dem deliberately empty am.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem come work out say di tomb bin don dey flooded bifor - ""dem bin build am underneath waterfall"" - just a few years after di king burial and move di contents to anoda location in ancient times.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na through going through tonnes of limestone for di chamber na im dem find parts of alabaster jars, wey dem write di names of Thutmose II and Hatshepsut.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis pieces of alabaster ""bin probably dey broken wen dem bin dey move di tomb,"" Dr Litherland tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""And thank goodness say dem actually break one or two things becos dat na how we find out who get di tomb.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di artefacts na di first objects wey dem find wey dey associated with Thutmose II burial.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Litherland say im team get a rough idea of wia di second tomb dey, and e fit still dey intact with treasures.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di discovery of di pharaoh tomb cap off more dan 12 years of work by di joint team from Dr Litherland New Kingdom Research Foundation and Egypt Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.</pidgin>

<pidgin>US President Donald Trump don tok say e go cut all future funding to South Africa sake of accuse say di kontri dey take pipo land and dey treat ""certain classes of pipo very bad"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Last month, President of South Africa Cyril Ramaphosa sign a new law wey allow goment to seize pipo land witout compensation in certain circumstances.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Land ownership for South Africa na controversial issue bicos na di oyibo pipo for di kontri still get most of di farmlands, 30 years afta di end of di racist system of apartheid.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pipo bin don dey call on goment to address land reform and deal wit di past injustice of racial segregation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>On Sunday, Trump write on im social media platform Truth ""I go cut off all future funding to South Africa until dem complete full investigation of dis situation!""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Later, wen e dey tok wit tori pipo, Trump say di South Africa goment ""dey do some terrible tins, horrible tins"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>""So dat one dey unda investigation right now.</pidgin> <pidgin>We go make a determination, and until we find out wetin South Africa dey do  dem dey take away land and dey confiscate land, and actually dem dey do tins wey dey perhaps far worse dan dat.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>In response, South Africa Minister for International Relations, Ronald Lamola, also write for X say im bin hope say Trump advisers go use ""dis investigative period to deepen dia understanding of South Africa policies as a constitutional democracy"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Such insights go ensure a respectful and informed approach to our democratic commitments,"" oga Lamola tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di South African president say di goment neva confiscate any land.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For inside one statement, Ramaphosa say di new law no be ""confiscation instrument, but na constitutionally mandated legal process wey go ensure public access to land in an equitable and just manner as guided by di constitution"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say South Africa no dey receive any oda funding from di US except for di US aid programme Pepfar, wey represent ""17% of South Africa HIVAids programme"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di US bin allocate about $440m in assistance to South Africa for 2023, according to data from di US goment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di South African goment say di new law no allow anyhow seizures of land as dem must first try to reach agreement wit di owner.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Vincent Magwenya, di tok-tok pesin for President Ramaphosa explain last month say di state ""no go seize property anyhow or for a purpose wey no be ...</pidgin> <pidgin>in di public interest"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say di current system of ""willing seller, willing buyer"" dey allow white farmers to delay di process of land reform.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, some critics don express fear say di law fit get disastrous consequences like e happen for Zimbabwe, wia land seizures bin scatter di economy and scare away investors.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Efforts to address di issue of land inequality for South Africa don cause criticism in di past, including from Elon Musk, who dem born for South Africa and wey now be one of Trump advisers.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Why you get openly racist ownership laws?"" Elon Musk bin respond to Ramaphosa statement on X.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For 2018, for im first term as president, Trump bin ask di US Secretary of State dat time, Mike Pompeo, to study South Africa ""farm seizures and expropriations and di large scale killing of farmers""."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Many Nigerians surprise afta di National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) release di inflation figure for January 2025, wey show say inflation drop to 24.48% from di 34.4%.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Bifor dis latest figures, di inflation rate for Nigeria bin drop only once in 2024 and dat na for di month of July wen e drop from 34.19% to 33.4%; and e start to increase steadily again until di end of di year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dat na why di recent January figures by di NBS wey show a drastic drop of about 10%, take many pipo by surprise.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to di NBS, dis development na sake of di rebasing wey dem do for di Consumer Price Index (CPI) wey be di main tool for measuring inflation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di CPI be like basket and many goods and service wey Nigerians dey purchase on daily basis full inside.</pidgin> <pidgin>Rebasing di CPI means say we dey swap out di outdated items for dis basket and we dey fill am wit oda newer items wey reflect wetin pipo dey buy today, and e go make sure say our inflation calculations dey more accurate,"" di NBS tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem further explain say dis new CPI basket include 960 products, up from di 740 products wey bin dey di old basket.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Consumer Price Index (CPI) na index wey dey give a general measure of changes in di average prices of goods and services wey consumers dey mostly buy compared to a period of time wey dem dey call di base year or price reference period.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One of di key importance of dis CPI na say dem dey use am produce kontri inflation rate among oda tins.</pidgin>
<pidgin>CPI rebasing na exercise wen dem dey carry out to make sure say di methodological basis upon which dem dey construct di CPI dey strong, logical and consistent with best practices.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to NBS, e specifically mean to bring di weight and price reference periods closer to di current period.</pidgin> <pidgin>(i.e di current consumption pattern).</pidgin> <pidgin>E go ensure say di inflation figure reflect current inflationary pressure and consumption patterns.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di simple answer na no.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na statistical process wey no directly get impact on di price of goods and service.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E dey only provide up to date measure of price change for di kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Paul Alaje wey be ogbonge economist tok say di concept of rebasing mean say di NBS change di reference year wey dem bin dey use to calculate inflation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Bifor now, di reference year wey di NBS bin dey use na 2009 but now dem decide to use 2024 as di reference or base year, Alaje explain for one interview wit Channels TV.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E further explain dat changing di reference year na best practice bicos two key decisions wey goment take recently - floating di naira and stopping fuel subsidy - bin get strong impact on di economy, so e no make sense to continue to dey use 2009 as di base year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""But dat one no mean say if you go market, di price don reduce, or to say di quality of life for di ordinary pesin don improve, however, di numbers go help to improve di image of di kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di only positive I fit give to dis, however, na di confidence wey dis new figures go bring to our economy in attracting Foreign Direct Investments (FDI).</pidgin>
<pidgin>Anoda sabi pesin wey chook mouth for di matter, Uche Uwaleke, a professor of capital market for Nasarawa State University, agree say dis recent figures no exactly mean say prices of food or oda commodities don come down well-well, e go fit boost Nigeria ability to attract investors.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Inflation na one number wey investors dey always look at bicos dem dey interested in di real rate of return on dia investment.</pidgin> <pidgin>So wen di inflation number reflect more accurately di inflationary pressure, e go put investors in a position to make a favourable decision,"" oga Uwaleke tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E add say im dey expect dis new inflation rate to also affect di decision of di Central Bank of Nigeria wen dem meet to discuss interest rates.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Meanwhile, one X user wey im handle na @ThaMVP ""E no be must say we go adopt methodology wey reflect international best practices but e no reflect di peculiarity of local events.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Anoda person, Maurice Ekpenyong, tok say ""food inflation dey more dan 100% and you want us to believe say e don drop to 26.08%?""</pidgin>

<pidgin>Charity Muturi don dey fight suicidal thoughts since she dey 14 years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For her 30s, di Kenyan bin dey diagnosed wit bi-polar disorder.</pidgin> <english>But instead of to allow her thoughts to keep her quiet, she become ogbonge advocate for mental health.</english>
<pidgin>Becos she sabi di kain shame and isolation wey conditions like di one wey she get dey cause, Charity bin work taya to carry di issue enta di goment eye to make sure say pipo wey dey in distress dey met wit care and not punishment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pipo wey sabi Charity call am say she dey selfless and unwavering, wey always dey give her time to help odas.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Her younger brother say ""like her name Charity, she bin dey full of love, very sacrificial and selfless"".</pidgin>
<english>For 6 November last year, Charity die by suicide.</english>
<pidgin>But her campaign to change how pipo dey see mental health for Kenya still dey on.</pidgin> <pidgin>Mental health campaigners say Charity work bin dey important to change di law around suicide for di kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For January dis year, Kenya High Court declare Section 226 of di Penal Code wey make suicide crime, say e dey unconstitutional.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Bifor anybodi wey try to kpai demselves fit face two years for prison or fine or both.</pidgin> <pidgin>Pipo wey attempt suicide bin dey often arrested and prosecuted instead of dem to get mental health support.</pidgin>
<pidgin>January ruling wey Judge Lawrence Mugambi give find say di law wey punish pipo wit mental health issues dey go against dia right to healthcare.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Psychologist and mental health advocate Amisa Rashid, wey work togeda wit Charity say di ruling na victory for Kenyans and honour Charity work to make am come true.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say, ""na very painful moment to pipo wey sabi am, dis go be her legacy"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Rashid say di struggle to bring wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues still dey go on.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say, ""sometins dey wey we need to change wey include di societal, behavioural and attitude chage about suicide.,""</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, Rashid say di struggle to bring about wider understanding and acceptance of mental health issues kontinue.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di criminalization of attempted suicide get complex history.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For colonial times, many African colonies bin get law against suicide and even though many kontris don comot di laws, some don keep am afta independence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Ghana wia dem decriminalise suicide for 2023, mental health sabi pipo report say early signs of improved public look even though di deep-seated cultural beliefs still be challenge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Akwasi Osei, wey be di former chief executive of di Mental Health Authority of Ghana, tell di BBC say e fit dey ""too early to get documented evidence"" of complete change in attitudes about suicide mata, but e clear sat di move don lead to ""improved perception about suicide and attempted suicide"" for id kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Kenya, mental health professionals hope say di ruling go encourage pipo to find help witout fear say dem go face prosecution.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But many pipo still believe say di stigma wey surround suicide go continue until more efforts dey made to educate di public.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Chido Madzvamutse, wey be mental health medical officer for di World Health Organization (WHO) African regional office say, ""decriminalization na step but we gatz move on to more open honest tok-tok about mental health generally.</pidgin> <english>To change society attitude need education, awareness and compassionate support systems"".</english>
<english>For many African societies, suicide still be taboo.</english>
<pidgin>Region and culture look am as immorality instead of health issue wey mean say di affected families no fit mourn come outside.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Kenya, e no dey uncommon say di familes go hide wetin cause di death bicos of fear of stigma.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For some communities, dem no dey do traditional burial for pipo wey die by suicide and even di families fit face discrimination and isolation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis cultural barriers dey make am hard for pipo to find support even wit di change of laws.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Religious leaders for many African kontris still dey against suicide attempts.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Archbishop Peter Ogunmuyiwa, wey be senior official for di Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN)  one of di kontri largest religious groups say, only God get rght to take life for offence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say, ""one of di strong laws for Bible be thou shall not kill.</pidgin> <pidgin>Na abomination bifor God, sin wey no get any forgiveness at all especially wen dem do am on purpose.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Archbishop Ogunmuyiwa say exception fit dey made for clinically certified individuals wit confam mental illness.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Sheikh Ibrahim Lithome, wey be Kenyan Muslim scholar and di legal and religious advisor to di Supreme Council of Kenya Muslims say suicide no dey allowed for di Islamic faith.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say, ""Life na Allah own and no one get right to destroy.</pidgin> <pidgin>No worldly punishment but ogbonge punishment dey for di afta life.</pidgin> <pidgin>For di pipo wey try suicide and survive also don commit sin"".</pidgin> <pidgin>E add say dem need ask for forgiveness.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say di survivors need support not punishment, say dem need counselling and spiritual guidance so dem go fit find hope.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even pass religion, Kenyan mental health advocate Amisa Rashid tink say cultural factors like language also get role to play for di stigma.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She explain say di Swahili word for psychosis mean ""mad pesin"".</pidgin> <pidgin>Dat kain word fit also isolate pipo wey get mental illness.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say to change di local language for mental health fit help ginger empathy and understanding.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ghana experience fit give ogbonge lesson to Kenya move.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Since dem decriminalize suicide, Ghana don launch national awareness campaigns and improve mental health services to encourage pipo to find help.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But di kontri still dey face limited mental health infrastructure and deeply held social stigma.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Nigeria wia suicide still be criminal offence, advocacy dey work wit goment to change di law.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One National Taskforce on Decriminalization of Suicide bin dey launched for 2024 to fit submit bill give parliament within di year.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Sabi pipo for Nigeria say Kenya court ruling fit be inspiration for dat kain tin to happun for dia kontri.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Cheluchi Onyemelukwe, wey be chair of Nigeria taskforce say, ""dem give us one year, we don dey work based on our terms of reference.</pidgin> <pidgin>We dey hope say within dis year, dis kain tin go happun for us.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even though di ruling from Kenya High Court na ogbonge move, di kontri parliament gatz take action ot formally comot di law.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Mental health advocates want sharp-sharp legislative action to make sure say di ruling cause real policy change.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di International Association for Suicide Prevention (IASP) dey work wit Kenyan partners to push for more reforms.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to Katherine Thomson from IASP, decriminalization na di first step, but goment must to invest in mental health services and public education campaigns.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say, ""Awareness for first responders; police, judiciary, community leaders and health care workers so dem go fit support pipo wit empathy and compassion.</pidgin> <pidgin>Media also get important role to how dem dey tok about suicides for news to support di shift for attitude.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>For advocates like Amisa Rashid, di memory of Charity Muturi na reminder of how continued advocacy dey important.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say, ""Charity voice bin dey powerful bicos she bin dey tok from her life experience.</pidgin> <pidgin>We need dat spirit to stay alive and make sure say pipo wey get mental health issues dey di front of policy tok-tok"".</pidgin>

<pidgin>According to Ruto, DRC palava e complex, delicate, don too tey, and involve plenty actors wey dey pursue different interests.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo wahala no no be today e start, and no be mata wey concern only di kontri, e don dey go on for many many years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ruto say e get ""one kain underground international dimension, wey dem no fit to ignore im determination, doubtful and destructive effects any longer.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Tanzania President Samia Suluhu Hassan wey host di regional summit say make regional leaders try find solutions to di conflict, beacos im dem fail, history go judge dem harshly.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""As regional leaders, history go judge us harshly if we sidon dey look di situation dey get worse day by day.</pidgin> <pidgin>And in line wit di philosophy of African solutions for African problems, our kontris get collective responsibility to make sure say we urgently address di existing insecurity challenges wey don heavily affect di life of innocent civilians""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Currently, two different peace negotiations naim dey go on, one for Luanda capital of Angola and Nairobi, capital of Kenya but di summit say dem want make di combine di two togeda to become one Nairobi-Luanda process, so di two go fit complement each oda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Plenty African kontris don send di army go eastern DR Congo as M23 rebels don seize plenty of di mineral-rich land for di region.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo big no be small.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di kontri wey be two-thirds di size of Western Europe get long history of outside interference.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So, who be di main players and wetin dey want?</pidgin>
<pidgin>Congolese President Flix Tshisekedi wan regain di territory wey im kontri lost to di rebels, including di largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent dem from seizing more.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im dey blame Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing M23 wit weapons and troops, wit di aim of stealing di kontri mineral wealth and to change regime.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im claim say Rwanda dey support M23 rebels na base on evidence inside one UN report wey many African and Western goments believe.</pidgin> <pidgin>And dem don demand make Kagame withdraw im forces.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But to Tshisikedi frustration, notin don happun.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Congolese leader dey also worry about keeping im seat.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I tink di political survival of im goment dey at stake,"" Jason Stearns, one former UN investigator for DR Congo and current professor for Simon Fraser University, tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda long-time leader Kagame dey di centre of dis conflict, but im sabi dodge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E also get long history of military intervention inside DR Congo wey get connection to di result of di 1994 Rwanda genocide.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda no gree say e dey provide military support to M23, but dey always tok say e go do anything necessary to defend imsef.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Kagame insist say Rwanda priority na to destroy one armed group wey Hutu genocide perpetrators, wey massacre Rwanda Tutsis, come run go wia now be eastern DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E accuse DR Congo army of joining forces wit dem and odas not just to slaughter Congolese Tutsis - wey M23 claim say dem dey fight to protect - but to threaten Rwanda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For diplomatic level, Rwanda want confirmation of im tori say di fight na Congolese problem, and Kigali just dey defend im borders against spill-over of di civil war.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda want make Kinshasa negotiate directly wit M23, Kinshasa refuse.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But wetin Rwanda really want according to Oga Stearns, na ""to maintain influence for eastern DR Congo"".</pidgin>
<english>Rwanda get both economic and security interests.</english>
<pidgin>Kigali deny UN evidence say e dey smuggle plenty gold and oda metals out of eastern DR Congo and sell dem as im own.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But access to DR Congo mineral wealth n aim di koko of conflict for many years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda dey see Burundi army as anoda security threat for eastern DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di kontri wey get borders wit both Rwanda and DR Congo don get thousands of soldiers dia for years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem bin to hunt Burundi rebels but now dem dey support Kinshasa army to fight M23.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Relationship between Rwanda and Burundi dey hostile.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di two kontris get similar tribes, but unlike Rwanda, di majority Hutus na dem dey rule for Burundi.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di two kontris don dey accuse each oda of trying to overthrow each oda goment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Burundi President Evariste Ndayishimiye bin post very strongly-worded warning on social media.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""If Rwanda continue to make conquests,"" im wrote, ""I know say war go even arrive Burundi...</pidgin> <pidgin>One day im [Kagame] go wan come to Burundi  we no go accept dat.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di war go spread.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis threat go continue if M23 continue im takeover from Goma enta province of South Kivu closer to Burundi border, wey be wia dem station dia force.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Stearns say, ""Burundi dey worry say, if Rwandan troops...</pidgin> <pidgin>extend dia influence into South Kivu e go fit destabilize di goment for Bujumbura.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Some dey fear di two wars wey bin occur for di region for late 1990s, fit repeat imsef.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dat war bin drag nine different kontris follow body and bin reportedly led to millions of deaths.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Uganda no dey directly involved, but imsef get troops for eastern DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem dey help Congolese goment with anoda different security threat  hunting down militants wey from Uganda wey dey connected to Islamic State group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Uganda role dey confusing  e dey work wit di Congolese, while at di same time, e dey allegedly provide at least complicit support to M23.</pidgin>
<pidgin>UN experts dey report say dis dey allow dem to use Uganda territory as a back base and supply route.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Kampala strongly deny am.</pidgin> <pidgin>But e don respond to M23 offensive by putting im troops in ""forward defensive posture,"" to prevent oda armed groups from exploiting di crisis, e say.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Area pipo for di conflict area don report say dem dey see Uganda soldiers dey move enta di conflict zone.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Like Rwanda, Uganda don enta eastern DR Congo before claiming say e dey protect im borders.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But e dey also face accuse say e dey steal DR Congo natural resources, especially gold.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Analysts expect am to protect im economic interests even as e dey watch di Rwandans.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E dey very clear say Uganda wan retain im own influence for eastern DR Congo and so dat im rival for Rwanda no g push am out,"" ICG Oga Moncrieff, tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>South Africa contribute most of di sojas to one Southern African regional force wey dey fight alongside di Congolese army and don suffer heavy losses.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But dem also make headlines sake of one hurtful exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg.</pidgin>
<pidgin>South Africans bin blame di deaths of 14 of sojas on Rwandan Defense Forces, wey President Cyril Ramaphosa refer to as ""RDF militia.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im defence minister claim say im bin warn Kagame say dem go take any more shooting as declaration of war.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis tok vex Rwandan president, wey tok say di account of dia conversation na ""lie"" and e call South Africans ""aggressive"" force wey must leave DR Congo."</pidgin>

<pidgin>All ova di world, pipo dey struggle to couple up.</pidgin> <pidgin>For places like Iran, Mexico, Peru, South Africa and South Korea, di number of pipo in couples dey fall.</pidgin>
<english>For China, marriages fall from 13 million for 2014 to just ova 6 million for 2024.</english>
<pidgin>And survey data from Finland suggests say cohabiting couples dey more likely to break up dan dem fit start a family.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So why pipo for so many places dey struggle to form a lasting relationship?</pidgin>
<pidgin>Felipe, wey be 36 years old and dey live for Santa Catarina for Brazil say e neva get relationship despite say e dey try evritin wey e fit do to find partner.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For school, e dey write love letters to girls wey e get a crush on but di response no dey encouraging.</pidgin>
<pidgin>While e dey university e offer to help girls wit dia course work hoping say dem go spend more time wit am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Den for im 30s e go for therapy to figure out how to connect wit women.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But tins neva work out so far.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I be man wey no sabi wetin to do wit love life,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Felipe dey work as a copywriter and spend most of im 20s witout stable job.</pidgin> <pidgin>E believe say dis dey hurt im chances to impress women.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""But no be somtin wey just dey happun to me,"" e tok and add say many oda men dey feel lost and opting out of dating.</pidgin>
<pidgin>US data suggest say 18 to 24 years old, especially men, spend more time alone dan any oda group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis na sharp opposite 20 years ago, wen dis age group socialise at least as much as pipo for dia 30s or 40s and much more dan dose wey be 50 and older.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Now, instead of spending time wit odas, young pipo dey spend am on social media, gaming and watching TV.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Brazil wia Felipe come from get di highest rates of social media use for di world.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wit young pipo spending more time online, e go follow say dem dey date for dia too.</pidgin> <pidgin>But di use of dating apps dey reduce.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, di world six biggest dating apps get downloads fall by 18% for 2024 - di first drop for dia history.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Liesel Sharabi, director of di Relationships and Technology Lab at Arizona State University, say users dey frustrated, exhausted and overwhelmed by dating apps - by di quantity of matches but not di quality of connections.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One of di issues she find na di veri little innovation for how dem dey match pipo.</pidgin> <english>Most apps get more male subscribers dan women.</english>
<pidgin>""Men find say dem dey get ignored and dat fit dey uniquely frustrating.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Sharabi say women dey feel overwhelmed by di number of responses dem dey get.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She also believe say apps don introduce a lack of accountability for dating wey fit lead to rude or inconsiderate behaviour.</pidgin> <pidgin>""Swipe afta swipe fit feel like say na products, no be pipo dem dey deal wit.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Hassana from Abuja, in Nigeria, neva get into dating apps.</pidgin> <pidgin>""E just feel like I dey auction mysef,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But she find offline dating difficult too becos di pool of men wey share her values dey small.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I be feminist and na di cost of knowledge, e get certain tins I no fit just close my eyes to anymore,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She be 26 and lawyer by training but she dey run one successful laundry business as well as non-governmental organisation (NGO) wey dey support victims of domestic violence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She believe say widespread access to di internet don give women for Nigeria di freedom to report domestic violence for ways dem neva do bifor wey mean say her generation dey more aware of di dangers of bad relationship.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Survey data from di US, China, South Korea and certain parts of Europe suggest a widening gap between young women - wey dey increasingly more progressive, especially wen e come to women rights - and young men wey dey less.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Alice Evans, wey be sociologist, call am di great gender division and e dey write book on dis subject.</pidgin> <pidgin>She believe say di way we consume culture online fit be one of di reasons why dis dey happun.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Women fit watch show wey dey cater to dia increasingly feminist interests wia men fit no dey progress at di exact same rate,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Hassana, dat na true, too often she don see man wey she dey interested in following a social media account wit misogynistic views or agreeing wit misogynistic comments.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E dey scary,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For Iran, 40-year-old Nazy get di same problem.</pidgin> <pidgin>She don dey single and dey look for love for di past 10 years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But many women still get expectations of a partner wey dey rooted in traditional conservative roles.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Nazy and Hassana dey reluctant to partner wit someone wey no dey as financially secure as dem be.</pidgin>
<english>Both women get post-graduate degrees and good careers.</english> <pidgin>Di pool of available men dem fit consider as equals dey shrink.</pidgin> <pidgin>In most kontris, female graduates now outnumber men and girls outperform boys for school.</pidgin>
<pidgin>And wit less stigma around being alone, e dey get easier to opt out of dating, Dr Evans tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di rise of high quality personal entertainment mean say if dates dey boring, hey, you fit just stay in and watch Bridgerton or play video games,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She believe say na thoroughly good tin if pipo dey under less pressure to make a bad match.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But she dey worried about lack of connection among young pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""If men and women no dey spend time togeda sharing intimate thoughts, sharing dia different perspectives on di world togeda, den e become harder to develop empathy,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dr Sharabi wey study dating apps, agree say technology don remove some potential for real world connection.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I get young pipo wey tell me say dem fit see someone cute for bar but dem no go approach dem, dem go go into dating app to see if dem dey dia instead,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I tink in general we avoid human contact in a way wey we bin no dey do."""</pidgin>

<pidgin>European leaders meet for Paris for one emergency summit on Ukraine as United States and Russia presidents dey plan meet on Tuesday for Saudi Arabia to discuss peace deal.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Saudi Arabia peace meeting no go include Ukraine wey dey fight wit Russia, and European kontris wey don dey support Ukraine for di more dan two years war.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Russia Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov bin say for Europe no get role for any peace tok, suggesting say Europe want di war to continue.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Lavrov tok dis one as im bin dey leave to go Saudi Arabia for tok tok on Ukraine wit US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ukraine President Zelensky also dey Saudi this week, but im say im no dey involved for di meeting between US President Donald Trump and Russia President Vladimir Putin, as nobody invite am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For di emergency summit for Paris, UK prime minister Keir Sarmer say any settlement wey go happun for di Ukraine war go need to be ""lasting peace deal, not just pause for Putin to come again.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Starmer add say anoda important issue concerning di war, na di mata of ""wider peace"" wey be di ""collective security and defence of Europe.</pidgin> <english>And here I tink we get generational challenge,"" im add.</english>
<pidgin>After di meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz tell tori pipo Reuters say, support for Ukraine must continue, as I add say, nobody fit impose any order on Ukraine.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Scholz say, im no believe say defence suppose be part of EU budget limit and say di union go fit defence imsef by imsef, if kontris for Europe spend more dan 2% of GDP on defence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Scholz goes on to say that Germany will continue to invest in military spending, and that it must be more flexible with its budget rules.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di German Chancellor come add say ""no split"" suppose dey between US and Europe on responsibility for Ukraine security.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Meanwhile, UK Prime Minister don first tok say, im ready to put UK peacekeeping troops for Ukraine if and wen di war end.</pidgin>
<english>Russia launch full-scale invasion of Ukraine for February 2022.</english>
<english>According to Zelensky says at least 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed defending the country, while at least three civilians were killed on Sunday</english>
<pidgin>Europe bin dey expect more aggressive, America-first position from Trump administration, but e dey struggle to catch up as im bin no expect say tins go reach dis extent.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E dey struggle to understand Washington willingness to reach compromises wit Russia about Ukraine, regardless of how e go take affect Europe security.</pidgin>
<pidgin>US decision dey pain European kontris wey fit wan push back.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem believe say if dem no do so, dem go end up swallowing indigestible - possibly unsustainable - peace wey dem no go fit enforce.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But again, if dem push back too hard, though, dem risk breaking di transatlantic alliance into wider break.</pidgin>
<pidgin>And Europe influence dey limited, wit military capacity wey no too strong, sake of dem don depend on America security umbrella for years.</pidgin>
<pidgin>United States dey accounts for nearly 43% of all aid wey don go Ukraine since Russia invasion for 2022, according to Kiel Institute for World Economy.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis amount na about $120bn and e include all humanitarian, financial and military aid.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Europe as a whole don send less aid to Ukraine than US.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Funding through EU institutions account for just over 18%, wit di largest amounts of additional bilateral aid wey Germany dey provide (6.5%) and UK (5.5%) up to end of 2024.</pidgin>
<english>Looking at just military support for Ukraine, US dominate again for funding, providing 49.4% of all spending since January 2022.</english>
<pidgin>Germany provide nearly 10% and UK don give nearly 8% up to end of December 2024.</pidgin>
<pidgin>On Monday morning, UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer say UK dey ""ready and dey willing to put troops for ground"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even for Germany, ahead of one heated election, di foreign policy tok-tok pesin of di CDU party, wey dey expected to win most of di seats say, Europe largest kontri go also commit troops within international framework.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Trump administration no dey 100% sure of wetin dem wan do about Ukraine.</pidgin> <pidgin>Some mixed messages bin fly ova di weekend.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis one allow Europe tiny window of opportunity to try persuade di American president say dem be partner im no fit throw one side.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dem dey hope to do am via dis Paris meeting.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Europe leaders insist Kyiv must dey directly involved in ceasefire toks too.</pidgin> <pidgin>For long, dem don maintain di opinion say "" decisions about Ukraine no fit dey, without Ukraine"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>No be all European countries go dey for Monday summit.</pidgin> <pidgin>Na only those wit military might go UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and Denmark  wey dey expected to represent di Baltic and Nordic nations, plus di EU Council president and di secretary general of di defence alliance, Nato.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Reports say oda countries go later hold follow-up meetings.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Even for di small Paris gathering, e go dey hard, if not impossible, to agree on concrete defence spending increases.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Poland dey plan to spend 4.47% of dia GDP on defence for 2025.</pidgin> <pidgin>UK dey struggle and dem neva reach, 2.5% of dia GDP.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But leaders fit pledge to coordinate beta, spend more inside Nato and shoulder most of Ukraine post-war reconstruction.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di EU dey expected to boost dia defence effort too.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Large part of di Paris meeting go also focus on di question of sending troops to Ukraine afta a ceasefire.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di idea dem wan discuss no be about peacekeeping troops but instead, ""reassurance force"", wey dem go station behind, rather dan on any eventual ceasefire line.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di purpose of di European troop presence go be in three-fold.</pidgin> <pidgin>Firstly, na to send message to say dem no dey alone.</pidgin> <pidgin>Another message na to di US, to show say Europe dey ""do dia bit"" for defence of dia own continent, and di last message na to Moscow, to warn say if dem break di terms of an eventual ceasefire, no be only Kyiv dem go dey deal wit."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Di way dis two teams dey play, di way dis two defences dey play, dem go keep di game tight, especially di Eagles defence no go allow explosive plays.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But di key go be how di Chiefs go try stop Saquon Barkley.</pidgin>

<pidgin>How you fit bet against Patrick Mahomes at dis point?</pidgin> <pidgin>I think e go dey close and di Eagles go get a shot but Mahomes go find way to win anoda Super Bowl las las.</pidgin>
<english>Chiefs 30-27 Eagles</english>
<english>Patrick Mahomes</english>
<pidgin>Paul Higham, BBC Dis big games dey always come down to turnovers, third downs and di finer details - and coaches Andy Reid and Steve Spagnuolo don ready di Chiefs, dem dey beta prepared for those hot moments pass anyone else.</pidgin>

<english>Chiefs 27-24 Eagles</english>
<pidgin>Ben Collins, BBC E fit no dey flashy, but no be accident say di Chiefs continue dey win tight games.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wit dis teams wey dey so evenly matched, I expect anoda close one, wit Patrick Mahomes again doing just enough.</pidgin>
<english>Chiefs 24-21 Eagles</english>
<pidgin>Washington Commanders defensive lineman Efe Unfortunately, I don witness first hand say di Eagles fit blow out teams.</pidgin> <pidgin>I tink say di game go dey very tough.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Mahomes na magician, so e dey very hard to bet against him.</pidgin> <pidgin>I tink na 50-50.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Los Angeles Chargers kicker Cameron I tink di Eagles go win.</pidgin> <pidgin>I hate di Chiefs - you gatz hate di Chiefs as a Charger - so I no fit see dem win.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Indianapolis Colts cornerback Kenny Di name of di game na running di football.</pidgin> <pidgin>Philadelphia get one unique, effective, physical run game so Kansas City gatz stop di run, first and foremost.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For di Eagles, dem gatz mix up di run and pass and let Saquon be Saquon.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle Larry For di Chiefs, di key na to stop di run game.</pidgin> <pidgin>For di Eagles, na to stop Patrick Mahomes and dat link up e get wit Travis Kelce.</pidgin> <pidgin>E suppose dey exciting, I dey go 20-17 Chiefs.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Brian Thomas Di Chiefs go win.</pidgin> <pidgin>If dem keep di game close, Patrick Mahomes go handle di rest from there.</pidgin> <pidgin>If dem go out there and play hard, do what dem fit do, then di Chiefs go bring am home.</pidgin>

<pidgin>Fear of raid, detention and deportation don make many African immigrant communities for America dey panic, and dis don force some of dem to go underground.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Immigrants tell BBC say na inside house dem dey stay now, dem dey skip work, reduce dia presence for public functions and no dey allow dia children go school sake of fear say officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) fit detain dem.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One of dem na Kaduli, one Congolese migrant wey enta US 11 years ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem born Kaduli for Bukavu for di eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, just outside Goma, wey M23 rebels recently capture.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E be general physician bifor e run go DRC to escape arrest afta e criticise di President wey bin dey dia bifor, Joseph Kabila, say e change di constitution to extend im term limit.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Kaduli tell BBC say now im don reduce im movements for di US, wey include visits to restaurants and shopping centres, becos of fear say dem fit forcefully deport am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di current raid dey put us in permanent fear as dem dey confuse all immigrants as criminals, wey no be true,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I dey fear becos war dey on for Congo.</pidgin> <pidgin>To send pesin back to Congo na to kill di pesin.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Like Kaduli, Abdul, from Nigeria, also dey on di edge.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E go America wit im papa, wen e dey 10, dat na 30 years ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I dey caution my waka and get faith in Allah say evri tin go dey alright,"" di Wisconsin resident tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Abdul don hear and watch how ICE officials carry out dia operations for oda cities.</pidgin> <pidgin>E say im dey fear make di same tin no happun to am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E dey crazy how dem dey treat pipo, like say we no be pesin too.</pidgin> <pidgin>All of us be humans, and all of us dey bleed di same way,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>All di migrants we interview for dis tori say make only identify dem by only dia first names, dem dey fear retribution or attention from authorities.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Since e return to di White House for January, di Trump administration don take di mass deportation wit all seriousness, as dem dey raid undocumented migrants for major cities.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E redirect military resources to empower immigration officers to make more arrests, wey include for schools, churches and hospitals.</pidgin> <pidgin>Dis don draw criticism from civil and immigrant right groups.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem don detain thousands of pipo, both criminals and those wey no get criminal histories.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Last week, ICE officers bin intensify dia arrests, as dem dey detain around one thousand pipo evri day.</pidgin>
<pidgin>By comparison, Joe Biden administration bin carry out an average of 311 immigration deportations of mostly criminals daily, according to ICE.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Trump government also dey reason to enforce di Alien Enemies Act, wey go allow authorities to quickly deport migrants dem feel say dey part of an ""invasion or predatory incursion""  one law dem dey only invoke in wartime.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Pious Ali, one Portland city councillor for di state of Maine, tok say while deportations no dey new, dem dey abuse di process by raiding places like schools, churches and synagogues and ""dem dey openly parade pipo"" like criminals.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say for migrants wey dey worried, e dey important to ""write plan down for your family and put some food and money on di side"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>""If di agent knock for your door, dem no fit enta without a warrant from di court,"" e tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Many African migrants dey live in fear sake of di uncertainty around di renewal of dia kontri tenure under di Temporary Protected Status (TPS) programme.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis dey allow migrants from qualified kontris  usually kontris wey dey witness armed conflict, natural disasters or oda ""extraordinary and temporary"" conditions  safety to stay for di US and apply for work permits.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Sylvie Bello, chief executive of di Cameroon American Council (CAC), one Washington-based organization wey dey advocate for Central African migrants, tok say di current uncertainty na sake of di policies of di previous Biden administration.</pidgin>
<pidgin>She say her community bin hope say Oga Biden go extend di TPS to Angola and DR Congo wen e visit there for November, im only travel go di continent.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""But e fail dem,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Black Africans wey dem no extend dia TPS fit face deportation now under Trump,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>About one million immigrants from 17 kontris  5 for Africa  dey protected by di TPS programme.</pidgin>
<english>TPS for immigrants from Cameroon, Ethiopia and South Sudan go end dis year.</english> <english>TPS for migrants from Somalia and Sudan go end for 2026.</english>
<pidgin>""All my communities dey suffer from deportation anxiety,"" Sylvie Bello tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In recent years, Africans don increasingly turn to migration routes to enta America through South America and Mexico.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Nneka Achapu, one Texas-based US-Africa policy strategist, tok say dis na becos pipo see di Mediterranean crossing go Europe as too dangerous.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to di ICE annual report for 2024, dem deport around 1,818 African individuals from di US, wit Senegal, Mauritania, and Nigeria top di list.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Out of di 1.4 million noncitizens di ICE schedule to deport from di kontri as of November 2024, three percent na Africans.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Somalia top di list wit 4,090 individuals, followed by Mauritania wit 3,822, Nigeria wit 3,690 and Ghana wit 3,228.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""We gatz go through dis for four years or however long dis goes on,"" Abdul tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But US-Africa policy strategist, Nneka Achapu, tok say di situation fit be chance for di US African community to show dia resilience.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""As pipo face renewed attacks on immigrants, we dey reminded say di strength of African communities lie in working togeda, protecting di most vulnerable, and sharing critical resources,"" she tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Achapu believe say dis uncertain time na opportunity for African governments to reorganize themselves, confront di root causes of migration, and create economic opportunities for dia pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""If America continue to push immigrants away, China, Russia, plus oda global powers fit seize di opportunity to expand dia influence in Africa, offering alternative migration pathways, economic partnerships, and trade deals wey fit reshape di US-Africa relations in ways we neva fully grasp,"" she tok."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Dem redesign dia passport and comot di Ecowas logo, recently, although dem announce visa-free travel and residency rights to citizens of Ecowas kontris but we neva sabi how e go be now, wen di exit don take effect.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem bin tok say di decision na in di spirit of friendship, and to strengthen centuries-old ties among African pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Political sabi pipo dey worry say travel restrictions go further weaken regional integration, worsen di ease of doing business, and slow economic development if e dey effective.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Now, di three kontris go lose di duty-free trade benefits among member states wey Ecowas members dey enjoy.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Travel fit become difficult for oda West Africans wey go visit di Sahel kontries.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger dey landlocked wit no access to di sea, and dis go make dem dependent on dia coastal neighbours including Togo, Benin, Ghana, and Nigeria for international trade.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to Ecowas Trade Information Systems (ECOTIS), for 2022, Mali exports total $3.91 billion, wit imports of $6.45 billion, while Burkina Faso export na $4.55 billion, and import na $5.63 billion.</pidgin> <english>Niger record $446.14 million in exports and $3.79 billion in imports.</english>
<pidgin>For all dis trades to kontinu, di Sahel kontries go require access to ports of oda West African kontries, wey go attract higher costs  in tariffs and duties  if dem stop to be Ecowas members.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na for December 2000 dem introduce di Ecowas passport, and e provide di den fifteen member kontries wit visa-free movements within di region and function as international travel document.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ecowas citizens get di right to live within member kontri for up to three months, but dis fit change for those wey go visit kontries wey no longer be part of di regional bloc.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Also, wit intermarriages bin dey common especially around border areas.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Example na between Nigeria and Niger, Ghana and Burkina Faso, and odas.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Some family members wey wan visit relatives for Sahel kontries go now need visas to fit enta and e go be so for di Sahel states pipo too.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis na serious mata as e go further make weak regional integration.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Also business, economic development, and di continental free trade agreement go dey affected."</pidgin>

<pidgin>Dis week na humiliating week for nearly 300 Romanian mercenaries wey dem recruit to fight on di side of di army of di Democratic Republic of Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dia surrender come afta one rebel attack on di eastern city of Goma don also shatter di dreams of those wey sign up for di job to earn big money.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di BBC don see contracts wey show say dem dey pay these hired sojas around $5,000 (4,000) per month, while regular military recruits dey receive around $100, or sometimes dem no go even pay dem.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo bin contract di Romanians to help dia army fight di Rwanda-backed M23 rebels, wey say dem dey fight to protect di rights of DR Congo minority ethnic Tutsis.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wen di attack on Goma bin start on Sunday night, di Romanians dey forced to go hide for one UN peacekeeping base.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Troops and and state-of-di-art military equipment from Rwanda bin support di M23 rebels and dem manage to reach our positions around di city of Goma,"" Constantin Timofti, wey dem describe as co-ordinator for di group, tell Romanian TVR channel on Monday.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di national army stop to dey fight and we dey forced to withdraw.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Romania foreign ministry tok-tok pesin Andrei rnea tell BBC say ""complex"" negotiations follow, wey see as di M23 hand ova di Romanian fighters  wey e describe as private employees of di DR Congo goment on army training mission - to Rwanda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Goma siddon right on di border wit Rwanda  and tori pipo feem di mercenaries as dem cross over and surrender to body searches and oda checks.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Bifor dem cross over, phone footage show as M23 commander Willy Ngoma dey tok down on one of di Romanians in French, e tell am to sit on di ground, cross im legs and put im hands ova im head.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E ask am about im military training  I train wit di French Foreign Legion, di Romanian reply.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Dem recruit you wit salary of $8,000 per month, you eat well,"" Ngoma shout, as e point out di difference between dia money and dat of Congolese army recruit salary.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""We dey fight for our future.</pidgin> <english>No come for adventure here,"" e warn.</english>
<pidgin>E no dey clear where Ngoma dey get di $8,000 figure, but di contract wey one former Romanian mercenary show di BBC for October show ""strictly confidential remuneration"" for senior personnel wey start at $5,000 per month during active duty and $3,000 during periods of leave.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di agreement outline ""indefinite period"" of service, and contractors dey scheduled to take one-month break afta every three months of deployment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>I meet di ex-mercenary for Romania capital, Bucharest, wen I go investigate Asociatia RALF, wey one group of UN experts say na Romanian enterprise wit ""ex-Romanians from diFrench Foreign Legion"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Na Horaiu Potra, one Romanian wey describe himself as military instructor.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For June while in Goma, I bin notice those kain mercenaries for checkpoints and di ones dem deploy around di city, dem dey work closely wit di army.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ova di last three years, many pipo don report say dem dey see di Congolese troops dey drive wit army vehicles.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Wen dem land, everybody dey call dem Russian,"" Fiston Mahamba, co-founder of disinformation group Check Congo, told the BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I bin think say dem dey connected to Russian mercenary group, Wagner say dia presence dey for several African countries.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>In fact, Asociatia RALF fit also work across Africa  dia contract show say dem get various ""operational locations"", wey include ""Burkina Faso, DR Congo, Ivory Coast, Niger, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>UN experts say dem bring these two private military companies d to bolster its forces in 2022, not long after the M23 had regrouped and begun capturing territory in North Kivu.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di province don dey unstable for decades and plenty militias dey operate for there, dey make money from dia minerals like gold and coltan  dem dey use make batteries for electric vehicles and mobile phones.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di first firm DR Congo sign up na Agemira RDC, wey Olivier Bazin, one French-Congolese national dey head.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di experts say di company employ Bulgarian, Belarusian, Georgian, Algerian, French and Congolese nationals.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dia work na to renovate and increase DR Congo military air assets, renovate airports and ensure di physical security of aircraft plus oda strategic locations.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di second contract wey dem sign na between Congo Protection, one Congolese company wey Thierry Kongolo dey represent, and Asociatia RALF.</pidgin>
<pidgin>According to UN experts, di contract show say Asociatia RALF get expertise and extensive experience for di provision of security management services.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem go provide training and instruction to di Congolese troops on di ground through contingent of 300 instructors, many of dem Romanians.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wen I follow Oga Potra tok for July about di extent of im group involvement on di ground and weda dem follow for di fight, e ""We gatz protect ourselves.</pidgin> <pidgin>If M23 attack us, dem no go 'Oh, una just be instructors - go house'.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Oga Potra bin dey very active during di DR Congo mission until a few months ago wen e go back Romania - and dey for wrapped for controversy for di middle of di cancelled presidential election there.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem dramatically arrest am for December, and e deny providing security for di pro-Russian, far-right candidate Clin Georgescu.</pidgin> <pidgin>And since October, e don refuse to return di BBC calls.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di ex-mercenary, wey dey im his late forties and follow BBC tok on condition of anonymity, tok say im bin resign becos im dey unhappy on how Asociatia RALF deu operate.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say di Romanians do plenty things on ground for North Kivu ""Only very few of us be trainers.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""We dey work long shifts of up to 12 hours, dey guard key positions outside Goma.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>E maintain say di money no worth di risks di military contractors gatz take.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Missions dey disorganised, working conditions poor.</pidgin> <pidgin>Make Romanians stop dey go there becos e dey dangerous.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>E also claim say dem no do proper background checks, and some of di Romanian recruits no get military training  e use di example of one of im former colleagues wey be firefighter.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo government neva reply to BBC request for comment on weda dem carry out background checks, or about di pay disparity between di private contractors and Congolese troops.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di family of Vasile Badea, one of two Romanians wey die last February wen M23 fighters ambush one army convoy wey dey on dia way to Sake, one frontline town near Goma, tell BBC say na police officer im be.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di 46-year-old bin take sabbatical from di force and take up di role for DR Congo sake of di beta salary offer.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di policeman bin dey struggle to pay for one apartment e just get and need money to pay for am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Many more Romanians bin dey lured sake of di prospect of a well-paid job.</pidgin>
<pidgin>I meet one man for Bucharest for October, who go back im kontri dey find more recruits to go to Goma.</pidgin> <pidgin>E get military background and don do Nato tours for Afghanistan wit di Romanian army.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""We dey very busy trying to find 800 pipo wey need to dey mentally prepared for di job and sabi how to fight,"" di mercenary recruiter tell BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E say im no work for Asociatia RALF, and no gree tok which outfit e dey work wit.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Dem dey place di recruits for positions wey correspond to di level of dia training, ande dem dey earn between $400-$550 per day,"" e explain.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wen dem ask am about di recruitment process, e say e dey confidential.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Dem no dey publish dis kain work anywhere,"" e tok, and add say na on networks like WhatsApp you go see am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E show me one WhatsApp group where more dan 300 Romanians don sign up, many of dem be ex-military personnel.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For June last year, Rwanda government tok-tok pesin Yolande Makolo bin kick against di presence of mercenaries for eastern DR Congo, e say na violation of di Geneva Conventions, wey prohibit di use of hired combatants.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In response, Congolese government tok-tok pesin Patrick Muyaya dismiss wetin e call Rwanda perennial complaint.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""We get some instructors wey dey come train our military forces becos we know say we get urgent situation,"" e tell BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But one Congolese soja wey I meet for June express dia disappointment ova di army strategy.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di pay dey unfair.</pidgin> <pidgin>Wen e come to fighting, na us dem dey send go di front lines first,"" e tell BBC on condition of anonymity.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Dem [di mercenaries] dey only come as back-up.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>E confam say im pay na around $100 a month, but e no dey come on time or make dem no pay at all.</pidgin>
<pidgin>I follow am tok last week ago, and e confam say im stll dey stationed for Kibati, near Goma, where di army get base.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Things dey very bad,"" e tok for one voice note to me.</pidgin>
<pidgin>I no fit reach out to am since then - and M23 don take ova di base since and kill many sojas, including dia commander.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Observers say di quick fall of Goma point to DR Congo fractured defence strategy, where overlapping forces plus blurred lines of command later fall into di hands of M23.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Richard Moncrief, International Crisis Group project director for di Great Lakes, say mercenaries, di Congolese army work wit troops from di Southern African Development Community (Sadc), one local militia wey dey known as Wazalendo, plus sojas from Burundi also lead to di fall.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E create situation wia e dey impossible to plan military attack wen chain of command and responsibility dey messed up,"" e tell BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""I think say e dey important to work towards far greater coherence in di armed effort for North Kivu, probably reduce di number of armed groups or armed actors on di ground.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>For di ex-mercenary, di fate of im former Romanian colleagues no come as surprise.</pidgin>
<english>""Poor command lead to failure,"" e tell BBC."</english>

<pidgin>Di Democratic Republic of Congo dey inside serious trouble as fighters from di M23 rebel group don dey enta through di kontri east and dey battle di national army and dem dey capture key places as dem dey go.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In just two weeks, tori be say thousands of pipo don dey killed and di fighting don turn war of words between DR Congo and dia neighbour, Rwanda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So how DR Congo, wey be di biggest kontri for sub-Saharan Africa, carry demselves reach dis level?</pidgin>
<pidgin>You fit understand di start of dis kasala if you torchlight di tori of one man, M23 leader Sultani Makenga wey don dey accused of plenti war crimes allegations.</pidgin>
<pidgin>To look into Makenga life na to look into decades of war, some foreign intervention and di lure of DR Congo rich mineral resources.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im life start on Christmas day of 1973 wen dem born for di lush Congolese town for Masisi.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E bin dey raised by Tutsi parents, and at di age of 17 e comot school to join one Tutsi rebel group for Rwanda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di group wey dem call di Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) bin dey ask for more Tutsi representation for Rwanda goment wey dat time bin dey full of politicians from di Hutu majority.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem bin also want di hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees wey ethnic kasala bin pursue comot di kontri make dem come back house.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For four years, Makenga and di RPF bin fight di Hutu filled army for Rwanda.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di fight-fight join wit di 1994 genocide wen Hutu extremists bin kill 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wen e bin look dis time for one rare interview for 2013, Makenga ""My life na war, my education na war and my language na war...</pidgin> <english>but I respect peace.""</english>
<pidgin>Di RPF seize more and more lands small-small bifor dem match enta di Rwanda capital of Kigali so dem go overthrow di extremist Hutu goment, and many of dem run enta wetin today be DR Congo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Wit RPF for power, Makenga come join di official Rwandan army and rise to di rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One of Makenga fellow RPF fighters tell di RIft Valley Institute wey be non-profit research organisation say, ""e bin dey very good wit setting up ambushes"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Im progress for di Rwandan army sha take style hang.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di fact say e bin get only basic education and fit speak broken French and English bin dey stand as ""challenge to im military career"", according to di Rift Valley Institute.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem also tok say, till today, Makenga dey very reserved and dey find am hard to tok for public.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For 1997, e bin dey part of di Rwandan-backed forces wey las-las take ova power for DR Congo and comot long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko.</pidgin> <pidgin>To replace am, dem put veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Makenga bin start to dey clash wit im ogas dem.</pidgin> <pidgin>Rwandan authorities bin arrest am afta im refuse orders to go back to Rwanda, according to one UN Security Council report.</pidgin>
<pidgin>So, dem imprison am for many years for di island of Iwawa.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Meanwhile, di relationship between Kabila and Rwanda new leaders start to scata.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Rwanda bin wan crush di Hutu militiamen wey bin dey responsible for di genocide but dem run across di border for 1994.</pidgin> <pidgin>Rwanda bin fear say dem go come back and scata di kontri stability wey dem don struggle to win.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Kabila bin fail to stop di militants from organising and e also comot di Rwandan troops by force.</pidgin>
<english>Bicos of dat, Rwanda invade DR Congo for 1998.</english> <pidgin>Wen Makenga bin dey released from prison, dem appoint am as commander for di front line wit one Rwanda backed rebel group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Ova di years, e gain di reputation from being very strategic and skilled wit commanding large group of sojas to battle.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Afta Rwanda troops cross enta DR Congo, discrimination against di Tutsi community start to increase again.</pidgin> <pidgin>Kabila bin allege say di Tutsis support di invasion while oda officials bin ginger di public to attack members of di ethnic group.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Makenga wey still dey DR Congo bin accuse di Congolese leader say im betray Tutsi fighters ""Kabila na politician, and I no be politician.</pidgin> <pidgin>I be soja and di language wey I sabi na gun.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Plenti neighbour kontris bin dey dragged to di kasala as one ogbonge UN military force bin dey deployed to try keep order.</pidgin>
<pidgin>More dan five million pipo, na im dey believed say bin die for di war and afta.</pidgin> <pidgin>Most of dem bin die from starvation or disease.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di fight-fight bin officially end for 2003 but Makenga continue to dey work for armed groups to di Congolese goment.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In di spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga bin las-las join di Congolese goment armed forces for wetin dem call ""mixage"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>But di political stands for DR Congo dey always shift, and na so Makenga defect from di army to join di M23 rebellion wey bin dey on di rise.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di M23 bin don dey very active for DR Congo east say dem dey fight for Tutsi rights and goment no gree honour peace deal wey dem sign for 2009.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Makenga bin dey elevated to di rank of M23 general and den soon reach di top position.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For November 2012, e lead di rebels for ogbonge fight-fight, from wia dem capture di city of Goma, wey be major eastern city wey get ova one million pipo.</pidgin>
<pidgin>DR Congo and di UN bin accuse di Rwanda Tutsi full goment say dem back di M23.</pidgin> <pidgin>Kigali don deny dis allegation many times.</pidgin> <pidgin>But recently di official statement don shift, as goment tok-tok pipo say to fight near di border na security threat.</pidgin>
<pidgin>By 2012, Makenga and odas for M23 dey face serious war crimes accuse.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di US don impose sanctions on am say e dey responsible for ""di recruitment of child sojas and campaigns of violence against civilians"".</pidgin> <pidgin>Makenga say di accuse say M23 dey use pikin as sojas dey ""baseless"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di US also say e don commit and dey responsible for tins like killing and maiming, sexual kasala and kidnapping.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Apart from asset freezes, Makenga bin also dey face bitter division for inside di M23.</pidgin> <pidgin>One side back am as dia leader while di oda bin support im rival, Gen Bosco Ntaganda.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di Enough Project wey be non-profit group wey dey work for DR Congo say di two sides bin enta full war for 2013 wey kill three sojas and eight civilians.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Makenga side bin wine and Ntaganda run enta Rwanda wia e surrender to di US embassy.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Gen Ntaganda wey dem bin nickname ""Terminator"" bicos of im brutality, bin dey sentenced to 30 years in prison for war crimes by di International Criminal Court (ICC).</pidgin>
<pidgin>But months afta di Makenga win, anoda bigger threat bin come.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di UNbin deploy one 3,000 force wit di mission to support di Congolese military to fit take back Goma and ginger di M23 to withdraw.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di rebel group bin dey expelled from di kontri and Makenga bin run enta Uganda, anoda kontr wey dem accuse say dey support M23, wey dem too don deny.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Uganda don receive extradition request from DR Congo for Makenga but dem no act on am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Eight years later, plenti armed groups still dey scata di mineral-rich east of DR Congo but at least authorities dey free from dia most notorious militants.</pidgin>
<english>Until 2021.</english>
<pidgin>Makenga and im rebels carry weapons again anf take ova territory for di North Kivu province.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Several ceasefires between di M23 and di Congolese authorities don fail.</pidgin> <pidgin>Even sef last year one udge sentence Makenga to death in im absence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>For M23 latest advance, wey tori be say na thousands of Rwandan troops dey support di rebels, pipo neva too see Makenga in public.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Instead na im tok-tok pesin and Corneille Nangaa wey be oga of alliance of rebel groups wey include M23 na im dey run public speeches and statements.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But Makenga still be key player, and e be like say na behind di scene strategy e dey focus on.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E don tok say im fighting na for im three pikin, ""so dat one day dem go get bata future for dis kontri"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>E tok say, ""make una no look me as pesin wey no want peace o.</pidgin> <pidgin>I get heart and family and pipo wey I care about"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>But millions of ordinary pipo dey pay di price for dis kasala and if Congolese forces catch am, Makenga dey look death sentence.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Yet e no dey shake am.</pidgin>

<pidgin>A BBC investigation don uncover allegations say energy giant Shell don ignore repeated warnings say a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria get problems and corruption.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di multinational wey get headquarters for London, along wit di Nigerian goment, don constantly tok say work to clean up oil-polluted sites of Ogoni, wey kick-off around eight years ago, dey go on well.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But di BBC don discover evidence say dem bin don get continuos warnings over several years say di scheme, wey goment set up and funded by various oil firms to di tune of $1bn (805m), don dey suffer from different issues.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One close observer describe di clean-up project as a ""con"" and a ""scam"" wey don waste money and leave di pipo of Ogoni for di Niger Delta region to dey live wit di serious impact of oil pollution - 13 years afta a ground-breaking UN report lift di cover on di seriousness of dia situation.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shell tell di ""Di operating environment for di Niger Delta still dey challenging becos of di level of illegal activities such as oil theft.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Wen spills happun from our facilities we dey clean up and remediate, regardless of di cause.</pidgin> <pidgin>If na operational spill, we also dey compensate pipo and communities.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di allegations come as a civil trial dey expected to begin on Thursday for di High Court in London, wia lawyers wey dey represent two Ogoni communities of around 50,000 inhabitants go say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution wey occur between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from dia infrastructure.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di communities say di spills don leave dem without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and create serious risks to public health.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shell, wey don dey push to sell dia assets for di West African kontri to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, don indicate say dem go defend di claims.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem deny any wrongdoing and say spills for di region dey caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining wey di company say dem no dey liable.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di BBC don visit di affected areas for di Niger Delta, wia Shell, di largest private oil and gas company for di kontri, discover di existence of crude oil 68 years ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di UN say at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil don dey spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents for di Niger Delta region.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di spills don leave many families worried for dia health and livelihoods.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Grace Audi, 37, dey live wit her partner and two-year-old for Ogale, wia dem don get at least 40 oil spills from Shell infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, di UK-law firm wey dey represent di communities for dis case.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Her family and neighbours only get access to a contaminated borehole, forcing dem to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, 2.40) - for area wia di average daily wage dey less dan $8.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis na familiar story to many in Ogoni.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Paulina Agbekpekpe tell di BBC say lush greenery wey bin once surround di mangroves of her community for Bodo - wey no be one of dos wey dey go court on Thursday.</pidgin> <pidgin>She say di rivers and ponds wey dem dey use dey full wit different kain animals and fish, particularly periwinkle.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di place bin dey greener, not only mangroves, but all by di shoreline - e bin get pawpaw trees, palm trees and more.</pidgin> <pidgin>But during di spills, di destruction don pollute evriwia,"" di 50-year-old mother of six tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Her family for generations don survive on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Most of di children - from di drinking water - don get diseases.</pidgin> <pidgin>Many don die.</pidgin> <pidgin>Me I don lose eight kids.</pidgin> <pidgin>My husband dey sick.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Becos dem don take away our livelihoods, pipo for Bodo dey hungry and dem dey suffer.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>In 2011, di UN Environment Programme (UNEP) bin publish a major study into di impact of pollution on di oil-rich area.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem find out say members of one community for Ogoniland dey drink water wey dey polluted wit a known carcinogen at levels more dan 900 times above di World Health Organization (WHO) guideline.</pidgin> <pidgin>Di same chemical, benzene, dey detected in all dia air samples.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem also find out say sites wey Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claim say dem don remediate, still dey polluted and di techniques dem use bin no reach regulatory requirements.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di report conclude say a comprehensive clean-up of di area go take 25-30 years - and e lead to di formation of di Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep).</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis bin initially dey established by di Nigerian goment in 2012, but no clean-up start - until e come dey relaunched by a new goment in December 2016.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Hyprep dey part-funded by oil companies including di state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, wey give $350m.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, di BBC don see internal documents wey suggest say Nigerian goment bin warn representatives of Shell plenty times of di agency alleged fraudulent practices.</pidgin>
<pidgin>One pesin wey dey aware of di project tok to di BBC about dia concerns - and ask to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Na common knowledge say really wetin we dey do na scam.</pidgin> <pidgin>Most of am na to fool di Ogoni pipo,"" di whistleblower tok.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Na wayo wey dem play so dat more money go enta into di pot and end up in di pockets of politicians and oda pipo in power.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di allegations about failings for Hyprep</pidgin>
<pidgin>In di minutes of one meeting for 2023, wey representatives from Shell Nigerian subsidiary, di UNEP and Hyprep attend, dem point out say ""incompetent"" contractors ""dey engaged again"" and say make dem  no dey allowed to further degrade di environment"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>In a separate leaked report wey di BBC see from di same year, dem point out say laboratory results bin dey ""regularly reported wit deviations"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>In 2022, di UN write to Nigeria environment ministry, wit warning say if nothing change, di ""extremely poor standards"" of di clean-up go kontinu.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di BBC has ask HYPREP and di Nigerian goment to comment on di allegations but neva get any response.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But our investigation don reveal evidence say Shell dey aware of di problems.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In a meeting wit di British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes wey we obtain under di Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledge di ""institutional challenges"" of di clean-up agency and di chance of di refusal of ""future funding"" toward am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shell tell di ""Hyprep na agency wey dey established and overseen by di federal goment of Nigeria, wit dia governing council largely include senior ministers and goment officials, along wit five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single Shell representative.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dis no be di only remediation project for Ogoniland wey allegedly no dey work.</pidgin>
<pidgin>In 2015, Shell agree to a 55m settlement for a clean-up afta two catastrophic spills in 2008 from dia infrastructure in di Bodo area.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di company say di clean-up, wey di Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI) do, wey suppose to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and di Bodo community (and dey part-funded by di oil giant and Nigerian regulators) bin dey certified as 98% complete.</pidgin>
<pidgin>However, di BBC visit sites within di area and find say crude oil still dey smell from di soil and dey float ontop water.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shell and di BMI insist say any occurrences of oil spills for di region na becos of theft - dem sabi in di industry as ""oil bunkering"".</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Plans dey to call back di contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,"" Boniface Dumpe, a director for di BMI, tell di BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Na di responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of dia facilities, to ensure say re-oiling no go come from dia facilities.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""But for di areas wey dey cleaned.</pidgin> <pidgin>I go think say some responsibility also dey for di community to ensure say some illegal activities no go also cause re-pollution.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Shell say dem don take active measures to prevent oil spills wey oil bunkering cause.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di company ""We don take advanced steps to prevent dis activity and di spills e dey cause including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Di alleged failings in di oil clean-up come as Shell dey prepare to sell dia Nigerian subsidiary, di SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Some locals in Ogoniland don accuse di oil giant of ""running away"" from properly cleaning up di land and water wey dem allegedly don pollute.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem also fear say Shell fit still gain from di area by simply trading di oil extracted from di region in future.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Di operations of whichever oil operator go take over di relevant pipelines go get ogbonge impact on dia day-to-day life,"" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, tell di BBC.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem get incredibly little detail about wetin diz deals go lead to.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""E dey unclear how Renaissance [Africa] go act going forward.</pidgin> <pidgin>At least wit Shell we get means of holding dem to account.""</pidgin>
<pidgin>Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which dey come from di Niger Delta region.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Locals, wey dia main source of livelihood na agriculture and fishing, tell di BBC say since di discovery of oil, or wetin some refer to as ""black gold"", dia home don dey pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Dem say dem neva see any benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe wey blame recent oil spills for her failing crops.</pidgin>
<pidgin>""Formerly if I harvest I fit eat some wit my family and even sell some...</pidgin> <pidgin>but for di past few years I no fit get anyin E really dey bad,"" di 42-year-old tell di BBC.</pidgin>

<english>Actually I was amused how Andrew was desperately trying to convince himselfand methat he had gone to the reception with the avowed intention to deflate his empty-headed kontriman.</english>
<english>That is true, I said, but the outside world isnt all that important, is it?</english> <english>In any case people like Chief Nanga dont care two hoots about the outside world.</english>

<pidgin>He na my very good friend, no be so, driver?</pidgin> <english>Yes, sir, master, said the driver, who had hitherto seemed a most unfriendly man to me.</english> <english>- Now he broke into a broad smile showing smoke-and kola-stained teeth.</english>

<english>I dress to please myself, sir, said the writer becoming suddenly defiant.</english> <english>- Let me tell you, said Chief Nanga in a softened but firm tone.</english>
<pidgin>The greatest criticism a man like him seemed capable of evoking in our country was an Make you no min am.</pidgin>
<pidgin>You go do the thing sotay you go beg say you no want again.</pidgin> <english>- Ha, ha, ha, ha!</english> <english>What a country!</english> <english>I said.</english>

<pidgin>If na play we de play make you tell us because me I no wan waste my time for nothing sake.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Or you think say na so so talk talk you go take win Chief Nanga.</pidgin>

<english>It was interesting to methinking about it laterhow Chief Nanga who had been so loudly interceding for me (or appearing to do so) suddenly withdrew into expectant silence, praying no doubt that my fathers rage would push him over the brink.</english>
<pidgin>A-a, weting happen to the news?</pidgin> <english>asked puzzled Boniface the first time I played this trick.</english> <english>-  asked puzzled Boniface the first time I played this trick</english>
<pidgin>E no good make man de for darkness.</pidgin> <english>-  Two days later I had relented.</english>
<pidgin>If I be you I go take am down too, when I done finish take am up.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Turn you back make I see the nyarsh you go take fight Nanga.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But one thing I must make clear, he said suddenly.</pidgin> <english>- You have brought this trouble into my compound so you should carry it.</english>
<english>But why?</english> <pidgin>You de ask why, instead to thank God that they done withdraw your case?</pidgin> <pidgin>My case?</pidgin> <english>I tried hard to remember but couldnt and gave up.</english> <english>- My father should be coming any minute now and he would know.</english>
<pidgin>For I do honestly believe that in the fat-dripping, gummy, eat-and- let-eat regime just endeda regime which inspired the common saying that a man could only be sure of what he had put away safely in his gut or, in language ever more suited to the you chop, me self I chop, palaver finish; a regime in which you saw a fellow cursed in the morning for stealing a blind mans stick and later in the evening saw him again mounting the altar of the new shrine in the presence of all the people to whisper into the ear of the chief celebrantin such a regime, I say, you died a good death if your life had inspired someone to come forward and shoot your mur derer in the chestwithout asking to be paid.</pidgin> <english>- The End</english>
<english>If you are smart you will leave true masquerades up to those who know what to do with juju.</english>
<english>But you two little superintelligent vagabonds know, dont you?</english> <pidgin>You talking about us being an Oha coven, Oga?</pidgin> <english>Chichi asked, perking up.</english> <english>- Yes.</english>
<english>Deepening his voice for emphasis, he said, You see me again and you go see plenty hot peppa.</english>
<pidgin>What music you got?</pidgin> <pidgin>If its got gam-gbam dim-dim that shakes the very air I breathe, I dey grab, Jesuss General said.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Oga, she whispered, these days I dont really think I know who I am.</pidgin> <english>-  Anatov was silent.</english>

<english>And then mixed metaphors, unmixed blessingsshake you like a miner panning for gold!</english> <english>When we agree about sleeping separately we will have great times together.</english>
<pidgin>I beg una-o, said its peace-loving owner, make I de use my thing for walking-stick.</pidgin> <pidgin>-  E better so.</pidgin>
<pidgin>No be for see umbrella we de roast for sun since we waka come here dis morning.</pidgin>
<english>I began to wonder at one point if I hadnt made a foolish gesture in refusing the ticket for one of those nicely spaced-out, numbered seats, that now seemed so desirably cool.</english>
<pidgin>And the fool who oppresses him will make a particular point of that You see, they are not in the least like ourselves.</pidgin>
<pidgin>The young trader found his voice then and asked, Oga, you want kill me?</pidgin> <english>If I kill you I kill dog, said the soldier with a vehemence I found totally astounding.</english>
<pidgin>Make I x madame small sometin, he pleaded.</pidgin>
<english>What is it?</english> <english>Because I dont want to...</english> <english>We laughed and I tried to kiss her but she covered my mouth with the palm of her hand...</english> <english>Wait!</english> <english>I havent nished yet...</english> <pidgin>And she sang the but twelve oclock done knack and my mama go vex with me.</pidgin> <english>-  What is it</english>

<english>When His Excellency got to him and But of course you know Beatrice, he had Me?</english> <pidgin>I am sorry sir, I have never seen her before, which must be about the most predictable and tired of Bassa witticisms and yet it always produced some laughter most of it on this occasion from the humorist himself who immediately added as if to bring everything down again to the literal level of those not bright enough for high Long time no see, Beatrice.</pidgin>
<english>Me!</english> <pidgin>Wetin concern me there.</pidgin> <pidgin>-  Plenty plenty.</pidgin>
<pidgin>See what?</pidgin> <english>I beg commot for road, and I made to push my trolley past him to the cashier but he grabbed my arm and pulled me back and proceeded to give me in loud whispers accompanied by conspiratorial backward glances a long and completely absurd account of all the actions and reactions he had meticulously observed between Chris and me in the last few months which could only have one meaninghis friend, Chris, done catch!</english> <pidgin>You de craze well, well...</pidgin> <pidgin>I beg make you commot for road.</pidgin>
<english>I tell him he has no clear role for women in his political thinking; and he doesnt seem to be able to understand it.</english> <english>- Or didnt until near the end.</english>
<english>But the way I see it is that giving women today the same role which traditional society gave them of intervening only when everything else has failed is not enough, you know, like the women in the Sembene lm who pick up the spears abandoned by their defeated menfolk.</english> <english>- It is not enough that women should be the court of last resort because the last resort is a damn sight too far and too late!</english> <english>That was about the only serious reservation I had about Ikems political position.</english>
<pidgin>As he looked around in surprise a police constable stepped out of the shadows and Na you get this car?</pidgin> <english>Yes, anything the matter?</english> <pidgin>Why you no put parking light?</pidgin> <pidgin>Parking light.</pidgin> <english>- That was a new one.</english>

<pidgin>Na you people de make the law na you dey break am.</pidgin>
<english>The growing crowd of spectators stood in silence in a circle around the car and the chief actors, the policeman playing his role of writing down somebodys fate with the self-important and painful slowness of half-literacy...</english> <english>At long last he tore out a sheet of his note-paper and handed it like a death warrant to Ikem.</english>
<pidgin>If you no come or you come late you de go answer for court.</pidgin>
<pidgin>And when you come for Monday make you bring am.</pidgin>

<pidgin>We de go out before but you t sidon small.</pidgin>
<pidgin>When I see you smiling like person wey win rae I who be this again?</pidgin> <pidgin>Then my brain just make krim and I remember...</pidgin> <pidgin>Who your friend be?</pidgin> <pidgin>My friend de drive taxi like myself and he be member for Central Committee of Taxi Driver Union.</pidgin>

<pidgin>Make you no worry for that, said his friend, Madam de look am well well.</pidgin>
<pidgin>That day I come pick madam from here I think say them make small quarrel...</pidgin> <english>Shut your mouth.</english>
<pidgin>Who tell you say we de make small quarrel?</pidgin> <pidgin>Madam, I no need for somebody to tell me when man and woman make small quarrel.</pidgin>
<pidgin>When you see the woman eye begin de ash like ambulance you go know.</pidgin>
<pidgin>But that day when I de vex because oga shine torch for my eye the same madam wey de grumble come tell me not to worry because the oga can talk sharp but na very kind man.</pidgin>

<pidgin>That wahala for road no be such bad thing as he come make us friends now for house.</pidgin>
<english>Ikem could understand well enough the roots of the paradox in which a mans personal choice to live simply without such trimmings as chaueurs could stamp him not as a modest and exemplary citizen but as a mean-minded miser denying a livelihood to one unemployed driver out of hundreds and thousands roaming the streetsa paradox so perverse in its implications as to justify the call for the total dismantling of the grotesque world in which it growsand ourishes.</english>
<pidgin>I done talk say if you no want bring money for buy better car why you no take one good Peugeot from oce as others de do and take one driver make he de drive am for you.</pidgin>
<english>He saw himself as an explorer who has just cleared a cluster of obstacles in an arduous expedition to earn as a result the conviction, more by intuition perhaps than logic, that although the nal goal of his search still lies hidden beyond more adventures and dangers, the puzzles just unravelled point unambiguously to inevitable success.</english>
<pidgin>Wetin I de hear, Ikem?</pidgin> <pidgin>Na true say dem done sack you?</pidgin> <english>Ikem nodded his head as he pressed her to himself.</english>

<pidgin>Then he got up Elewa, lets go!</pidgin> <english>What had caused all this agitation had been a subsidiary item tagged on to Ikems news because of its relative unimportance and prefaced accordingly with the In another development...</english> <english>Yes, in another development, according to this smug newscaster dispensing national anguish in carefully measured milligrammes, six leaders from Abazon who were involved in a recent illegal march on the Presidential Palace without police permit as required by decree had been arrested.</english>

<english>Where did it come from?</english> <english>Why did it feel deliciously decadent?</english> <pidgin>Without any trepidation whatsoever, I gunned the car down the expressway towards the market, not actually hearing her say, Okay.</pidgin> <english>-  We spent about an hour in the market and another at the home of an equally attractive friend of hers to whom she introduced me as her new friend.</english>

<pidgin>I have heard others say it makes them look cool.</pidgin> <english>- For me it was none of the above; okay, that is a lie, it was a little bit of the second.</english>
<pidgin>*** The night the wahala that would define year one in Uniben for me erupted, I was supposed to sleep in Wilhelms BQ.</pidgin> <english>- He lived alone in the two-roomed Boys Quarters of a friend of the family in Professors Quarters.</english>

<pidgin>Make we tell Yibril?</pidgin> <english>I asked.</english> <english>- Are you crazy?</english> <pidgin>You wan start confra war?</pidgin> <english>Tuoyo whispered the questions, as though he was afraid that the night would carry the gist.</english>

<pidgin>In later years, I would ask myself why I did not make a move that day.</pidgin> <english>- But as I looked at Tseyes face (she had taken off her glasses), I was scared to spoil a beautiful thing.</english>

<pidgin>The guy wey get the store come dey ask me, Brotha, you get fever?</pidgin> <pidgin>I told him yes o, I get real fever.</pidgin>

<pidgin>It was one of the only things that could make Amide uncomfortable.</pidgin> <english>- She was like a gruff and quick-witted forties film noir girl.</english>

<english>At the gate she waited under the roof of the short walkway and watched as I manoeuvred myself around their flooded front yard, up the short remnants of a fence, and tightroped the rest of the way until I hopped down on the other side of the body of water, then she said, About my lack of boyfriends, Ewaen.</english>

<pidgin>The doctor continued, It was your money that got stolen, abi?</pidgin> <english>Mesiri nodded slowly as the juju man continued, You see how the two bones resemble?</english> <english>The oracle is saying that two friends, or two brothers who look so much alike that they could be twins, stole your money.</english> <english>- The other people who are not here, how many are they?</english> <english>Five, Tambo answered.</english>
<english>Would we forgive him this time?</english> <pidgin>When Tambo came out, he immediately started talking, I no tell you say the jazz dey work?</pidgin> <pidgin>Ewaen, I no tell you?</pidgin> <english>We looked at the idiot, talking as though nothing had happened.</english> <english>- Still with the spit-riddled, chewed- to-the-cuticle fingernails.</english>
<pidgin>She dabbed some more make-up on and said, Dont mind him o.</pidgin> <english>- He was playing hero.</english>

<english>What do you think hes going to do in Abraka?</english> <pidgin>You heard about the wahala there too, I murmured into her ear, ignoring the first half of her statement.</pidgin> <english>- My brother, Abele, is in year one there.</english>
<pidgin>Nothing really dey happen there o.</pidgin> <english>- My friends just invited me for a visit.</english>
<pidgin>Weyinmi go dey here while you travel?</pidgin> <english>I asked.</english> <pidgin>- No, o.</pidgin>

<pidgin>I, who knew Wilhelm the longest, said, He go dey there.</pidgin> <english>- Im sure he was there.</english>
<pidgin>But wetin dey do Wilhelm?</pidgin> <english>I explained, Wilhelm problem is that he never knows when to stop, he does everything until the end.</english>
<pidgin>But for confra wey he no wan join before?</pidgin> <pidgin>If not for that wahala in year one, would Willy be in Black Axe?</pidgin> <english>And to travel to another school and shoot somebody?</english> <english>What kind of cold-blooded crowd does he move with?</english> <english>Tuoyo asked the questions quickly, rhetorically; he knew the answers to each of them.</english> <english>- Maybe he wasnt there when the guy was shot.</english>
<pidgin>He smelt the cigarette first before seeing me and turned from his rapt audience saying, Why una tell me say no cigar for this house?</pidgin> <pidgin>Ewaen, abeg, bring that smoke here.</pidgin>
<english>Why are you guys making noise?</english> <pidgin>Tambo, wetin happen to you?</pidgin> <english>I asked.</english> <english>- Tambo took a long drag from the stick and said, Oh boy.</english>
<english>This bastard shouted that he was going to blast Harry himself, that Harrys father was a pompous prick who disrespected other members of their extended family.</english> <english>- Tambo said that Yibril went for Frank, pulled him up and started threatening him with a pistol to his head.</english>
<pidgin>Tuoyo spoke first, But this doesnt make any sense.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Abeg, make I leave message for Wilhelm.</pidgin> <english>- I was surprised to find out that he was back from Abraka.</english>

<english>A nurse shouted, No!</english> <english>Leave him there!</english> <english>Let the doctor come and see.</english> <english>- A nurse shouted, No - Leave him there</english>

<english>Was it really because he wanted to be with her when she heard Madu was dead?</english> <english>In the next few days, she was so taut with anxiety that he too began to worry about Madu and then resent himself for doing so, and then resent his resentment.</english> <english>- He should not be so petty.</english>
<english>She thought them all to be ugly and overdesigned, but she was so pleased by the rage felt on her behalf that she pointed at one of them and murmured, O maka.</english> <english>- It's lovely.</english>
<english>I see now how she made sure I was dead drunk before sending Amala to me.</english>

<pidgin>If he don see you, he wont die, so we mus go find you anywhere you are ...</pidgin> <english>Jagua sucked in her breath.</english> <english>- She looked at Brother Fonso, and Fonso was not there, only the darkness.</english>
<english>He had seen her married off and she had been wayward and had come to Lagos to pursue the Tropicana lights and the glittering laughter of seductive men, the sequin sheen of the fickle fashions.</english>
<pidgin>How I can come without money!</pidgin> <english>Is a shame!</english> <pidgin>And I never been home for over ten year!</pidgin> <english>No, is too much shame!</english> <pidgin>No money  all these years?</pidgin> <english>His voice was biting.</english> <pidgin>- And I never been home for over ten year -  No money  all these years -  His voice was biting</pidgin>

<pidgin>Jagua glanced by the side of the seat to make sure.</pidgin> <english>- She could not even remember how she performed that journey, but when the lorry turned into the familiar jungle drive, she knew she was home.</english>
<english>When she was small like this ...</english> <english>how could she know her life would run into these cross-currents of shame, bitterness and degradation?</english> <english>When she was small like this ...</english> <english>she had lived free and simple in Ogabu.</english>

<english>Rosa told how the magistrates face clouded as he added up the pros and cons, how Dennis stood in the dock, trembling.</english>
<pidgin>From dere I reach Krinameh and ...</pidgin> <english>She checked herself, unable to tell Rosa about the jealous incident when she had pursued Nancy Namme into the waters of Krinameh.</english>
<pidgin>Soon after you lef, de man come to Lagos.</pidgin> <pidgin>- He worryin about you till he nearly crase.</pidgin>

<english>I described a man who, like Ekwensis Amusa Sango, was seeing a new citysomething with a feeling.</english>
<pidgin>You dont like to see your gal frien naked in de street.</pidgin>
<pidgin>When I talk, you say I talk too much  Which gal frien?</pidgin> <pidgin>Tell me, which gal frien?</pidgin> <pidgin>Sam appeared and said, Is true, sah.</pidgin> <english>- I tink is the gal who jus lef here.</english>

<pidgin>Why you don marry Aina?</pidgin> <english>The gal like you too much.</english>
<pidgin>Why you don marry her?</pidgin> <english>Sango merely smiled.</english>
<english>Women with trays of big juicy tomatoes, basins of garri, or corn, or melon seeds, women who sold trinkets and plastic buckets and dyed cloth, men who sold coral charms and wooden combs and turtle-doves and string vests and cotton trousers and slippers, women who sold mosquito coils and magic love mirrors and hurricane lamps and tobacco leaves, with stalls of patterned cloths next to those of fresh-fish traders, jostled everywhere, filled the roadside, sprawled in fantastic confusion.</english>
<english>Striding as if he were on stage, waving his hands angrily, the landlord Why do I have to come and pester you for my rent, eh?</english> <english>When you wanted the room you came and begged me.</english>
<english>Must I sing to you all night, for seven days, and sacrifice two white hens, and two dizzying bottles of ogogoro, before you hear me?</english> <english>And even now your mother is wandering about in the night, crying to the wind and the road and the hidden angels, looking for a way to reach you.</english>

<english>The woman, Iya Iyabo, lived in a small bungalow whose exterior was identical to a small balcony, two windows with louvres and nettings, an electric meter box clamped to the wall, and a storm door, except that her fence was not made of bricks and cement but of mud and clay.</english> <english>- The fence was cracked in places from long exposure to the sun, and was littered with spots and smears.</english>
<english>She often spoke Yoruba to Mother, who perfectly understood the language, although she never believed herself proficient in it and almost never spoke it otherwise, but would always have us talk with people on her behalf.</english>
<pidgin>As her husband come inside, she tell am make im give medicine money, but im start to beat-beat am and im pikin.</pidgin> <english>-  Chi-neke!</english> <english>Mother gasped, and covered her mouth with her hands.</english>
<english>Then bending so that nothing but her legs alone became visible under the door of the refrigerator, she He wont; where will he go?</english> <english>I dont know, Boja replied, but I fear.</english> <english>-  He wont; this fear will not last, it will leave him, Mother said in a voice that was assured, and I could tell at the time that shed believed it.</english>

<pidgin>Aderonke vex say im dey beat the sick pikin, and fear say because of im alcohol, say im go kill am, so she hit im husband with a chair.</pidgin> <english>-  Eh, eh, Mother stammered.</english>
<pidgin>The food Id just scooped into my mouth was instantly forgotten at this news of Oga Biyis death, for I knew the wasted man.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Come make we go talk outside, Mother said.</pidgin> <english>- The woman rose, and together, with Nkem following, they went out.</english>
<english>All attention went to them as Fathers voice leapt from communal Im deeply sorry, your Lordship, to Nne, biko, ebezina, eme naife aDo not cry, dont do this.</english>

<english>Dear Ladies & Gentlemen,Thank you for your interest in advertising on the Nairaland Forum!Nairaland runs aTargeted Ad Platformwith which any Nairaland member can place adverts on the sections of Nairaland where the people he/she wants to reach are most likely to be found (for example, a political party could place ads on the politics section with it).To place ads on Nairaland, the first step is to get your ad banner designed by agood graphic designer.</english> <english>Your ad banner must be borderless, 318 pixels wide, 106 pixels tall, less than 30kb in size, and in the PNG or JPG format.</english> <english>Once it's ready, go to click (Upload Ad) to upload yourbanner adandlanding page, and wait for approval.</english> <english>(Your ad might not be approved if it's deceptive or illegal or morally questionable in some way).After your ad is approved, we will provide you with information about how to purchase advertising credits so you can freely place your ads on any section of Nairaland - including the home page.</english> <english>Our system is extremely simple by design.Please see ourEstimated Advertising Ratesto find out how much it'll cost to advertise on the various sections of Nairaland on the long run (prices on the short term are strongly correlated with traffic levels).</english> <english>Billing takes place every few minutes and you will get detailed reports on unique clicks and views and charges for each ad/section and for your entire account over various time periods.We look forward to doing business with you!Best regards,Seun Osewa.</english>
<english>How do you charge?</english> <english>Per click?</english> <english>Per impression?</english> <english>Per hour?We charge for approximate value delivered.</english> <english>This is highly correlated with traffic on the short run.</english> <english>So when there's less traffic, you pay less, and when you're charged more, it will most likely be due to an increase in traffic.</english> <english>However, on the long run, that's not the only factor we consider.</english> <pidgin>We have developed a robust pricing algorithm to make sure that you will always get what you pay for.What kind of ads would you not accept on Nairaland?We will reject ads that we consider to be ethically or morally questionable in one way or the other.</pidgin> <english>We reject ads for HYIPs and most MLMs because they are fundamentally unsustainable.</english> <pidgin>We reject ads for health remedies that make claims that have not been verified by NAFDAC because we know that they don't work as advertised.</pidgin> <pidgin>We also reject some mailing list building ads because we don't want our members to be spammed.</pidgin> <english>Sexual ads will only be accepted of placed in the sexuality section.Can we submit animated ads?No.</english> <english>This is because they are distracting.</english> <english>If your ads are attractive and well targeted, people will notice them without any animations.</english>

<english>I placed my ad on a section of Nairaland but the placement has been 'pending;'for a very long time.</english> <english>Why?There are six advertising slots in every section of Nairaland.</english> <english>This means that only six advertisers can place their ads on any section of Nairaland at the same time.</english> <english>Once the six slots are full, any attempt to place ads on the same section by other advertisers will result in a pending placement.</english> <english>However, once a slot is vacated by an advertiser for one of 2 reasons - manual removal or running out of ad credit - the slot will be handed over to the advertiser with the earliest pending placement.</english> <pidgin>That is, "1st come, 1st served!"How long will I have to wait for an ad slot to be vacated so my placements can be activated?It's impossible to say when an ad slot will be vacated since it depends entirely on what current advertisers choose to do.</pidgin> <pidgin>However, we have observed that some advertisers like to pause their ads at night, while others like to do so during the weekends, especially on Sundays.What can I do while I'm waiting for my desired ad slot to be vacated by its current occupants?While you're waiting for your ad placement to become active, you should (1) Placing your ad on very similar sections that have free slots and don't have a price premium, especially those that are being discounted.</pidgin> <english>(2) Creating new ads to target sections that are less similar.</english> <english>Please resist the temptation to remove and then resubmit pending placements.</english> <english>If you do that, you will be placed at the very end of the queue.Why is this issue more pronounced in the section where I want to place my ads, and what are you doing about it?We have just launched a smart algorithm that will gradually balance the demand for and supply of ad slots in the various sections of the forum.</english>
<english>OFFICIAL STATEMENT FROM THE DIRECTOR OF COMMUNICATIONSOur attention has been drawn to the recent false rumors alleging that Senator Prince Ned Munir Nwoko is planning to marry Nollywood actress Chika Ike as his seventh wife and that she is pregnant for him.</english> <english>We categorically state that these claims are entirely baseless and a product of malicious speculation.Similarly, reports claiming he made statements about Tuface and polygamy are completely untrue.</english> <english>As a public figure and with his wife also being an actress, it is not unusual for bloggers seeking attention to fabricate such stories.</english> <english>However, Senator Nwoko is currently on a national assignment, focused on delivering on his political mandate, and has no time for distractions.</english> <english>This office remains available to journalists for verification of information, and we remind media practitioners of the consequences of spreading fake news.</english> <english>The public is advised to disregard these rumors and rely only on official statements from his office.SignedDirector of CommunicationsOffice of Senator Prince Ned Munir Nwoko</english>

<english>Federal Lawmakers Loyal To Wike Knocks Falana, Threatens Anarchy If Amaewhule Isn't Recognized ISSUED BY THE RIVERS STATE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY CAUCUS.Gentlemen of the press.1.</english> <english>We have invited you this morning to extinguish the delusion,  prevarication, lies, and the deliberate distortion of facts and judgements of courts as it affects the Rivers State House of Assembly under the leadership of Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martin Amaewhule, the Governor of Rivers State.2.</english> <english>This has become very necessary as the governor has procured the services of some persons, including Senior Advocates of Nigeria, to turn the law and judgments of court upside down to skew public opinion to align with the GovernorTMs position and give him a reason not to obey any judgment of court that is against him or not in his favour.3.</english> <english>We wish to caution Mr.</english> <english>Femi Falana SAN, to stop misinterpreting judgments of court.</english> <english>It is regrettable that a very senior lawyer of his status will be amplifying the falsehood from  non-lawyers and political merchants.Falana, lied about the dates of the judgment of Hon.</english> <english>Justice J.K.</english> <english>Omotosho and the purported defection that never took place with the intention of misleading the public.We wish to warn these false content creators and political merchants that it is very possible to continue to eat from the treasury of Rivers State without tampering with the position of the law, and the intentional misinterpretation of judgment of courts.4.</english> <english>For the records, there were several reliefs aside from the presentation of the 2024 budget sought by the Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewhule led Assembly before the Hon.</english> <english>Justice J.K.</english> <english>Omotosho, which included the determination of who is the speaker and members of the Rivers State House of Assembly; non interference by the governor of Rivers State with the activities and functions of the MartinTMs led Assembly;  protection by the Inspector General of Police to ensure adequate security for them to carry out their duties; and the disbandment of any other House of Assembly in Rivers State or Self-acclaimed Speaker other than Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewhule and the 27 members.5.</english> <english>All the reliefs sought by Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewhule were granted by the Hon.</english> <english>Justice J.</english> <english>K.</english> <english>Omotosho on the 22nd of January 2024.We hereby produce the orders of the Hon.</english> <english>Justice J.</english> <english>K.</english> <english>Omotosho, as affirmed by the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.We refer the Press to pages 6 to 16 of the Judgement.6.</english> <english>ItTMs instructive to state emphatically that by the withdrawal of the GovernorTMs appeal before the Supreme Court and the dismissal of the suit with cost, the judgment and all orders made by Hon.</english> <english>Justice J.</english> <english>K.</english> <english>Omotosho, which was upheld by the Court of Appeal, takes effect immediately and forever.</english> <english>This, of course, includes the affirmation of Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewule as Speaker and the 27 members of the Rivers State House of Assembly as the ONLY House of Assembly of Rivers State and the directive to the Inspector General of Police to provide security to enable the Rivers State House of Assembly to continue to perform their functions without hindrance.7.</english> <english>We wish to call the attention of the Governor of Rivers State, that in his Notice of Withdrawal before the Supreme Court, he rightly referred to Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewule as the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly.</english> <english>Therefore, there is no more contest as to who the Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly is.</english> <english>And any attempt to continue to deal with any person or forum as the Rivers State House of Assembly is not only contemptuous of the judgment of the Supreme Court but a direct call for political anarchy or social lawlessness.The shameless and contemptuous actions of giving any assignment whatsoever to anybody purporting same to be Rivers State House of Assembly other than Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins.</english> <english>Amaewule led House of Assembly should stop forthwith.8.</english> <english>The Governor of Rivers State having failed to use the Court of Justice Wali to unseat the 27 lawmakers, has initiated a plot at a Federal High Court in Rivers State to declare the seats of the Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewule and the 27 members vacant, even when a Federal High Court, Appeal Court and the Supreme Court have all affirmed Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewule and the 27 lawmakers as the only Rivers State House of Assembly.9.</english> <english>We are calling on the Executive Arm to execute the judgment of the Court of Appeal, affirming Rt.</english> <english>Hon.</english> <english>Martins Amaewule and the 27 lawmakers as the only Rivers State House of Assembly to avoid any breakdown of law and order in Rivers State.1- REP.</english> <english>Kingsley Ogundu Chinda DSSRS(Minority Leader)2- SEN.</english> <english>Barry Mpigi  DSSRS(NASS Rivers Caucus Leader)3- RT.</english> <english>HON.</english> <english>Dum Dekor , DSSRS(Leader, Rivers State Caucus House of Representatives.)</english>

<english>Wike in the mud</english>
<english>Ride on Governor SIM Fubara the good people of Rivers State are fully behind youWike to the mud againOtilor</english>
<english>We the gud people of River state Is solidly behind Falana and Fubara.</english> <pidgin>Thunder fire any bastard wey the tin pain.</pidgin> <pidgin>They tink Fubara is Adeleke that is soft.Send any bastard to government house jail and leave them their to die.</pidgin> <english>Bastards.</english>
<english>Lizard of ikwere..</english> <english>wike is shitty..</english>
<pidgin>Since you couldn't pass JAMB after 7trials, you are not in a position to dispute someone who read, understood, and have practiced law for many years as ur Falana has been misinterpreting and misleading some people for a long time, I don't know why NJC can't call him to order.</pidgin> <english>Falana should tell veiwers that, everything he is his saying is his own opinion.</english> <english>Falana it's only the court can declare any elective seat vacant in Nigeria not you</english>
<english>where in this report did the lawmakers threaten anarchy?It is a pity that Femi Falana has allowed himself to be reduced to this low level of wilfully spreading lies and fake information that he knows to be fake.</english> <pidgin>I don't just get it.</pidgin> <english>Is Falana that hungry?</english> <pidgin>Gani Fawhenmi would be shaking in his grave by now.You don't even have to be a lawyer to know that with the withdrawal of his appeal by the Governor and the subsequent dismissal of the appeal, the judgement of Justice Omotosho is now law.</pidgin> <english>That judgement has settled the question of who the rightful Speaker of the Assembly is.</english> <english>Any action contrary to that judgement is in contempt of the Supreme Court.</english>
<english>Ok</english>
<english>More troubles being created in Nigeria fighting war at all fronts.</english> <pidgin>I don't think Rivers people will allow these men create any war from Abuja</pidgin>
<pidgin>Falana has been misinterpreting and misleading some people for a long time, I don't know why NJC can't call him to order.</pidgin> <english>Falana should tell veiwers that, everything he is his saying is his own opinion.</english> <english>Falana it's only the court can declare any elective seat vacant in Nigeria not youEveryone has been giving their interpretation of the judgment, why are you picking on Falana?</english>
<english>If what?</english>
<english>I like Sim nut I hate lies.I'll stand for truth anyday anytime.The truth is by law the 27 members are the Rivers state assembly recognized by law.See the orders of Justice Omotosho that the Governor Sim appealed that was upheld at the appeal court and and supreme court.</english>
<english>Everyone has been giving their interpretation of the judgment, why are you picking on Falana?is the thread not about falana or you just jump to quote without reading?</english>

<english>We the gud people of River state Is solidly behind Falana and Fubara.</english> <pidgin>Thunder fire any bastard wey the tin pain.</pidgin> <pidgin>They tink Fubara is Adeleke that is soft.Send any bastard to government house jail and leave them their to die.</pidgin> <pidgin>Bastards.I use my 2 balls to second this your motion.As e dey sweet us, e dey pain dem.....</pidgin>

<english>Former Governor of Anambra State,Peter Obi, has called for the immediate reopening of markets that were collaterally affected by the closure of the Head Bridge Market in Onitsha.The market was shut down by regulatory and security agencies due to alleged trading in illegal drugs within a section known as Ogbo Ogwu.While condemning the sale of illicit drugs, Obi, in a statement on Monday via X, emphasised the need for fairness in the enforcement of the law.One unequivocally condemns such illicit drug trading activities and urges the government to take all necessary measures to eradicate the sale of fake itemsespecially drugsand legally prosecute the perpetrators for the health and safety of society, he stated.Their continued closure is severely affecting the livelihoods of millions, especially during this difficult period in our country, Obi wroteHe also called for transparency in the search of shops, urging authorities to involve store owners during inspections.The search should be conducted transparently, with store owners present while their shops are inspected and items removed by the law and due process, he advised.Recalling his tenure as Anambra governor, Obi shared his approach to handling similar situations.Whenever we encountered public health threats, we addressed them collaboratively and methodically with the relevant agencies.</english> <english>In cases requiring market interventions, we worked closely with regulatory authorities and security agencies, ensuring fairness and due process, he explained.He urged the state government to reconsider the current strategy to prevent undue hardship on traders and protect the stateTMs economy.A more balanced and transparent approach will enhance both security and economic stability, Obi added, emphasising the need to weigh public health measures against their economic impact.</english>
<english>The fight against Igbo business interests is in full swing, but just as always since 1966, they will end up hurting Nigeria and its stuttering economy.</english>
<pidgin>If dem born him Mama well, let him go and open the market</pidgin>

<pidgin>If dem born him Mama well, let him go and open the marketYou will still lose as usual.</pidgin> <english>Whether the markets are open or shut, you're on the losing side.</english> <pidgin>Just don't develop HBP because the drugs to treat you may be in those trucks.</pidgin>
<english>The fight against Igbo business interests is in full swing, but just as always since 1966, they will end up hurting Nigeria and its stuttering economy.You support importers of fake drug?I pray you guys secession issue is resolved so you can go your own wayOur reasoning and way of life are miles apart</english>
<english>Obi is a very foolish person for asking for this.Peter obi will never become the president of Nigeria</english>

<english>This kind of human being should not be the leader of even an estate.</english> <pidgin>So if by some stroke of bad luck he had won, that is how he would have covered up crimes like these?Anyway I am no longer shocked at the kinds of things he stands for.</pidgin> <english>I will not be shocked if it is revealed one day that part of the rise to some form of affluence was also by been involved in illicit activities like these.</english>
<pidgin>If dem born him Mama well, let him go and open the marketIf dem born well, as a BATist, free yourself from Tinubu's renewed hopeless noose after  been BATified by a BAT</pidgin>
<english>Obi is a very foolish person for asking for this.Peter obi will never become the president of NigeriaWhat he is actually saying is that those involved in or caught dealing in illegal or fake drugs should be decisively dealt with within the confines of the law.</english> <english>Only the shops belonging to those culprits should be marked for closure, rather than closing the entire market and punishing innocent people who are conducting legitimate business.Most especially in this economy, it will negatively impact the livelihoods of others doing lawful business in the same market.In summary, close down the shops of those caught in illegal drug activities and deal with them, but do not shut down the entire market.</english> <english>ItTMs like punishing innocent people for a crime they know nothing aboutTM</english>
<english>TohIs Peter Obi in support of fake drugs?Obi went to the market to sympathize with the traders after some shop was shut down.Like sympathize with People selling fake drugs?</english>
<english>The fight against Igbo business interests is in full swing, but just as always since 1966, they will end up hurting Nigeria and its stuttering economy.all fake products from u criminals who value money than human lives will b destroyed n God will destroy u tooAs for that obi, every sane Nigerian have seen the bastard for the clown he is now.</english> <english>Supporting fake manufacturers n considering money factor instead of human lives at stake</english>
<english>You will still lose as usual.</english> <english>Whether the markets are open or shut, you're on the losing side.</english> <pidgin>Just don't develop HBP because the drugs to treat you may be in those trucks.only a sick patient ready to die will use a drug from IgboThat's a pure death wishPeople who make fake tyres n fake drugs even for babies</pidgin>
<english>As an economist, you cannot wake up and close an entire market like that.</english> <english>It will backfire on everyone.even if what they are producing in that market are killing people then u should keep it openPeople should keep dieing so Igbos can b making their money?Is that not what u are saying?Even if 500 people are dieing from the fake products of that market daily, the government should allow people to keep dieing so Igbos can b making moneyNo wonder that Thai police called u people d scum of the earthImagine mentality</english>
<english>The problem with vultures of babablus is that their brains have been vandalized.</english> <english>They can never understand simple English.Obi is simply saying that sections of markets not connected to fake drug sales or fake products should not be closed.Here in Aba, the entire Ekumi plaza have been sealed for a week.</english> <english>There are people who sell other products like weavon, clothes, electronics, phones etc in same plaza.</english> <english>They have been denied their daily income for a week and still counting.</english>

<english>was heightened tension at the Lagos State House of Assembly on Monday as security operatives from the Department of State Security (DSS) and the Nigeria Police stormed the complex, sealing the offices of Speaker Mojisola Meranda, her deputy, and the Clerk of the House,News360 Nigeriareports.By 10 a.m., heavily armed security personnel had taken control of the Alausa, Ikeja premises, conducting thorough checks on anyone attempting to gain entry.</english> <english>The dramatic scene intensified when Speaker Meranda arrived at about 15 a.m., visibly emotional and shedding tears as she witnessed the heavy security presence.The crisis follows the controversial removal of former Speaker Mudashiru Obasa by 32 out of 40 lawmakers while he was in the United States.</english> <english>Describing his removal as a coup, President Bola Tinubu and members of the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) have remained divided over the decision.Obasa has since taken legal action, filing a suit at the Ikeja High Court challenging the legitimacy of his removal.</english> <english>His lawyers, led by Chief Afolabi Fashanu (SAN), have sought an expedited hearing of the case, naming the Lagos State House of Assembly and Speaker Meranda as defendants.</english>
<english>Mrs.</english> <english>Akerele Bucknor also shed tears like this, but haters laughed at her.</english>

<english>This is unacceptable</english>
<english>Hmm</english>
<english>This is very bad</english>
<english>Crocodile tears.She knows quite well that politics is not a game of emotion and sentiments, especially with the way her predecessor was impeached.No need seeking sympathy in the court of public opinion because the game is the game.</english> <english>Politics is not a game for the 'weak' as she's portraying.</english>
<pidgin>SOMETHING WEY SHE SUPPOSE DON ORGANIZE BOYZ MAKE DEM GO BURN DOWN OBASA HOUSE</pidgin>
<english>The message is clear.Obasa has been properly dealt with but as a strong man, he just wan flex muscle</english>
<english>Why the confusion?</english> <pidgin>Who is their oga at the top now backing?</pidgin> <english>I think that is what matters to their followers there</english>
<english>If I'm this woman, I would go public and mention Tinubu name, telling the whole world his involvement in the saga.People should grow ball and  confront tyrannist.</english> <pidgin>Even for once.Weakness of tyrants is, wen you confront them back, they quickly retreat.</pidgin>
<english>Interesting</english>
<pidgin>Na waBetta Edu cry pass this one........Nigerian politics no be any woman mate</pidgin>
<english>It's going to be a difficult one for the APC paid social media agents.Few weeks ago, they were praising this woman and bashing Obasa.</english> <english>Called him all manner of names, from fake lawyer, political jobber, tout etc.Forgetting all he had done for the party, because their paymasters suddenly supported Meranda.Will they now turn around and cuss her out?</english> <english>The same woman they praised shortly ago?Or will they somehow drag Obidients into something that doesn't even concern them?Let's see how it plays out?</english>
<english>She has bitten more than she can chew ...</english>
<english>The slave master is at work.</english> <pidgin>ronus will learn d hardway</pidgin>

<english>I support her as well, Obasa should just accept his fate and move onSeems like tin boss hasn't accepted his fate.Operatives from the Department of State Security (DSS) and the Nigeria Police invaded the state assembly on Monday, sealing off the offices of Speaker Mojisola Meranda, her deputy, and the House clerk.The invasion of the state assembly complex is seen by party leaders as TinubuTMs attempt to return Obasa to his post and re-establish his political control of Lagos State.</english>

<english>TheUnited States has commenced deportation proceedings for Nigerian nationals, with 85 individuals set to arrive in Lagos, while 116 others remain in detention.The Federal Government, through the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs,Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu,has expressed concerns over the process, calling for a more humane approach.Odumegwu-Ojukwu, in a statement signed by her media aide, Magnus Eze, on Sunday, disclosed that with about 201 Nigerians currently detained in US immigration centres and about 85 cleared for deportation, the government is advocating for adherence to internationally prescribed guidelines.Similarly, she reiterated the governmentTMs stance in a post on her official X account on Monday, titled US Deportations Begin.Lagos as Sole Deportation DestinationThe United States also confirmed that deported Nigerians will be flown directly to Lagos.Mills emphasised that individuals serving prison sentences in the US would be among the first group of deportees.Those to be repatriated would be dropped in Lagos.</english> <english>There would not be room for whether it should be in Port Harcourt or Abuja.The first group will be convicted prisonersthose who committed crimes and are in US prisons.</english> <english>Some of them are those who have clearly violated US immigration laws.They appealed but were denied yet they are still in the US.</english> <english>They have committed immigration crimes, people who have been ordered to leave, Mills stated.Bianca expressed concerns over the emotional and financial impact of deportations on Nigerians in the US and their families, emphasising the need for humane and compliant processes.With the new administration in the US, we want a situation where there will be commitments.</english> <english>If there will be repatriation, we want a dignified return.At the moment, weTMre told that about 201 Nigerian nationals are in US immigration camps, and about 85 have been cleared for deportation.Will there be any way of ameliorating their pains?</english> <english>This has been of great concern to not just Nigerian nationals in the US but family members in Nigeria who depend on them for survival, children whose school fees are paid for by these diasporans.We are asking as a country whether they will be given ample time to handle their assets or will they just be bundled into planes and repatriated?</english> <english>It will really be traumatic, especially for those who had not committed any violent crime, she asked.TrumpTMs Immigration CrackdownThe deportation process comes as part of a broader immigration crackdown by the Donald Trump Administration.</english> <english>On his first day in office as the 47th President of the United States, Donald Trump signed several executive orders aimed at tightening immigration policies.These include ending birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border.He also announced the deployment of more troops to the southern border and reiterated his pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.These policy shifts, according to multiple media reports, have heightened concerns among immigrant communities.</english>
<english>U.S has stopped providing us with USAID.</english> <pidgin>Now they are to deport us back to our Nativeland...NIG 0 Vs USA 2Well, since there is no more USAID to Cushion the effect of AIDS, the best thing is to think twice before I use my device because the quickest way to contract the HIV na through the Device.......</pidgin>
<english>The world favors conservative ideology, same way as Nature/EvolutionI have nothing against seeing people of different culture/Race trying really hard to sanitize their own land and stopping infiltration of wanderers into their spaceI even hope that locally, we can start gravitating towards something like this, either covertly or officially in form of a regional Government/Ethnic Nation</english>
<pidgin>To come and do what please??</pidgin>
<english>They are welcome home, let's join hands together and build our countrySome of them are staunch trump supporters who thought the deportation would only affect the Muslims, now they are faced with ugly reality</english>
<english>Welcome back to Nigeria.Tinubulation Promax is still onVillage People are happy</english>
<english>Sad.But this pain is avoidable.Absolutely nothing wrong with emigration...just do it the right way.</english> <pidgin>Should serve as a lesson to other Nigerian nationals living illegally in other societies.They should better make things right or return home in whatever way possible.Really feel for these ones....</pidgin> <english>especially those that have lived in the US for years.May God strengthen them and their loved ones, and show them mercy.</english>

<english>Members of the Lagos State House of Assembly have condemned the invasion of the Assembly complex by operatives of the Department of State Services (DSS) and the Nigeria Police on Monday, describing it as a rape of democracy, an aberration, and a national embarrassment.During a plenary session attended by 36 members, the lawmakers demanded an explanation from the Lagos State Director of DSS regarding the reasons behind the invasion.They also called on the National Security Adviser, Nuhu Ribadu, to investigate the incident and provide the public with a comprehensive briefing on the findings.</english> <english>Additionally, the Assembly urged President Bola Tinubu to intervene immediately and prevent the situation from escalating further.Expressing their outrage, the lawmakers unanimously condemned the invasion, describing it as an abuse of legislative procedure and a threat to democratic governance.Speaking during the session, Hon.</english> <english>Abiodun Tobun This is not a government ruled by the barrel of a gun.</english> <english>This is an aberration of democracy and a step toward anarchy.</english> <english>What happened today is a total embarrassment and an act of harassment.He further affirmed the lawmakersTM loyalty to the Speaker, Nobody can dictate to us.</english> <english>God chooses and removes leaders.</english> <english>We are solidly behind your leadership, Mr.</english> <english>Speakernobody can remove you.The lawmakers suggested that powerful and influential individuals or groups might be behind the incident, calling for a thorough investigation to uncover those responsible.The House remained united in its stance, insisting on protecting the independence of the legislature and ensuring that such actions do not undermine democratic processes in the state.</english>

<english>Obasa Vs Meranda</english>
<english>A team of police officers attached to the Area F of the Lagos State Police Command have been detained for allegedly extorting a Chinese expatriate along the Sheraton-Opebi link Road area of the state.PUNCH Metro learnt that the incident occurred when the officers numbering three were conducting a stop and search at the location on Wednesday.The police officers were said to have flagged down the foreigner and requested his documents, including a green card.Although the expatriate presented the documents through his phone gallery, the officers insisted on seeing the original copies.A rights activist, Lameed Adekunle, who was privy to the development told our correspondent on Sunday that after a series of discussions and pleas from the expatriate, the officers forced him to pay N100,000 into a Point Of Sale account.He said,The expatriate was on his way for an urgent meeting when the police officers stopped him and demanded his documents including his green card which was shown to the officers through a phone gallery but the officers insisted on seeing the original.</english> <pidgin>Because he was unable to provide it, the officers requested N100,000 and since they did not want to get late to the meeting, they had to make the payment into the account provided to them.Speaking on how it became public knowledge, Adewale Ojo of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights said the expatriate, who works with a popular construction company, narrated his experience to his Nigerian co-workers who later escalated the matter.He said,The man just moved to Nigeria and he felt so disappointed in the way he was treated.</pidgin> <english>He had to tell some of his workers who later informed us.</english> <english>We took it up, informed the police authorities and the officers were identified.</english> <english>This also led to their arrest and detention.He further stated that the policemen were summoned to the provostTMs office in the Ikeja area of the state, adding that they had since been detained.Ojo added the police officers were instructed to refund the money to the foreigner.The money is expected to be refunded tomorrow,  Monday.</english> <pidgin>We are doing this to make sure that the bad eggs in the police are fished out and we also want to follow this particular case to the end like we have always done,he added.In a picture sent to our correspondent, one of the officers was seen conversing with the expatriate in his vehicle.A receipt of the transfer bearing the name of the expatriate and the recipient was also seen by our correspondent.The command spokesperson, Benjamin Hundeyin, could not be reached for a reaction as calls made to his telephone line were not answered.</pidgin> <english>A text message sent to him had yet to be replied to as this report was filed.PUNCH Metro reported in October 2024 that officers from Area C Police Command in Surulere allegedly extorted the sum of N1m from three members of the National Youth Service Corps members.It was gathered that the corps members were stopped along the Surulere expressway before a group of officers surrounded their vehicle and started searching.An argument ensued between the corps members and the officers before the vehicle was driven to the Area C Police Station where the extortion was said to have taken place.</english>

<english>Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mojisola Meranda, may resign today, according to sources.This is just as officials of the Directorate of State Service (DSS) allegedly stormed her office sealing it in the process.Sources said armed security personnel have taken over the premises of the House at Alausa, Ikeja, and environs.This comes few weeks after the former Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, was impeached but his impeachment has created crisis in the house, with Obasa rejecting it.There are indications that Obasa might return as the Speaker following the intervention of President Bola Tinubu.</english>

<english>Tension has enveloped Osun State over attempts by some hoodlums to take over local government secretariats in the state,News360 Nigeriareports.Residents, especially those who live around the council secretariats, have been thrown into panic as sporadic gunshots rent the air.It was gathered that as of 00 a.m.</english> <english>on Monday,some armed hoodlums invaded many council area offices, including Osogbo and Olorunda, and started shooting.Many pupils and students who were on their way to school ran back home as drivers deserted the affected areas.Checks at Olorunda and Osogbo councils showed that the presence of security operatives prevented the hoodlums from accessing the government offices.It was gathered thatsome sacked chairmen of the APC stormed the Olorunda secretariat with the aim of taking control; however, some loyalists of the PDP and security agents were able to chase them away.Our correspondent gathered that the same incident happened at government offices in Iragbiji, Odo-Otin, Ife Central LGAs, among others in the state.Some videos obtained by The Guardian also revealed that suspected thugs loyal to the All Progressives Congress and the Peoples Democratic Party in Ifelodun Local Government Area in Ikirun clashed at the council secretariat in the presence of security agents who were deployed to maintain law and order.Recall that Governor Ademola Adeleke had on Sunday raised the alarm over an alleged attempt by his predecessor, Gboyega Oyetola, to forcefully return the sacked council chairmen to office.Oyetola, while reacting, had asked the governor to obey an order of the Court of Appeal in Akure that reportedly reinstated the chairmen, who are members of the opposition All Progressives Congress in the state.Picture of Osogbo LGA secretariat overtaken by security operatives.</english>

<english>Men of the Department of State Security, DSS, and Nigeria Police, in tye early hours on Monday, stormed the premises the Lagos State House of Assembly, sealing up the offices of the Speaker, Mojisola Meranda, her deputy and clerk of the house.As of 10 am, armed security personnel have taken over the premises at Alausa, Ikeja, and environs frisking every passersby.Meranda, however, arrived with her convoy at about 11.15am.Recall that the embattled, former Speaker of the House, Mudashiru Obasa, has sued the state lawmakers challenging his removal as the Speaker of the Assembly.Obasa, it was gathered, has filed a motion at the Ikeja Division of the State High Court, where he is also seeking an accelerated hearing of his suit.Obasa was removed in absentia by 32 out of the 40 members of the state Assembly on January 13, 2025.</english> <english>He was in America when he was removed in a situation described as coup, by President Bola Tinubu.The development has generated controversy with members of the Governance Advisory Council, GAC, an apex political decision making body in All Progressives Congress, APC, in Lagos, divided over ObasaTMs removal.Obasa, in the suit, was challenging the legality of his removal from office.The motion, made available to Vanguard Media was filed on Wednesday, 12 February, 2025, names the Lagos State House of Assembly and Mojisola Lasbat Meranda, current Speaker of the House, as defendants.</english>
<english>Order from Aso Villa</english>
<english>Order from above.This means one thing - Obasa is still in TUluMbU's good books.</english>
<pidgin>DSS storms Lagos Assembly, seals Speaker, deputyTMs officesI don't think is my business.</pidgin>
<english>Seunmsg hope you see what I said about a month ago.</english> <english>Nlfpmod let's buy popcorn.</english> <english>Tinubu  should learn to let go, APC will loose Lagos if this is not resolved amicably.</english>
<english>Order from Aso Order from above..You guys are just confusedWhen Obasa was impeached, majority of you, including Salamrushdie were saying the reason for the impeachment was because he wanted to contest against Seyi Tinubu for the Lagos Governorship post, attributed the saga to TinubuNow, a counter action is taking place and you are blaming Tinubu for this againYou're confused.</english> <english>Try to think independently.</english> <english>There's more to everything happening around you than Tinubu</english>
<pidgin>I don't think is my business.Baba sopee.</pidgin>
<english>Obasa is a goner crew would be confused now.</english> <english>What goes around comes around</english>
<pidgin>Ghen ghen!It's looking like a long action movie</pidgin>
<pidgin>Hmm ...</pidgin> <english>Seem Obasa wields immense power than the Lagos state government</english>
<english>goldie of kennis music died february 14th 2013, i saw no post here on little remembrance about her on valentines day,she was a legend in the little time she spent in the music industrymodified< to those saying shit about her, goldie was number 1 female artiste during her period, sasha p, kel,kemistry,bouqui av all dimmed as at then..she was number 1 as at that period</english>
<pidgin>Power Play!!!!It's about to go down.It's like baba is in support of obasa oo.Something strong is giving obasa liver.Make we wait and see Sha</pidgin>
<english>The Last Kick of A Dying Horse.There is no way ObasaTMs removal as the Lagos State House of Assembly Speaker can be reversed.Let the tout & fake lawyer go and rest.</english> <english>He has stolen, misappropriated & embezzled enough tax payers money.</english>
<pidgin>no man land done dey get owner</pidgin>
<english>WowWonderful movie</english>
<english>power</english>
<pidgin>Ghen gheeen!it's gonna be a long night in Lagos!Adieu Lasgidi!</pidgin>
<english>Abuja Power.</english>
<english>Obasa is a checkmate for Sanwo.</english> <english>He's a tool for controlling the Governor.Tinubu believes that with Obasa gone, he has lost the control of the House and having lost control of the House, he's also lost control of the Governor.</english>
<english>So who will the apc minions support?</english>
<english>Order from above...</english> <pidgin>Trouble sha</pidgin>
<pidgin>They should allow this man to become Lagos State governor in peace naHaha</pidgin>

<pidgin>Peter Obi should not think this move will make him win Lagos again in 2027.</pidgin>
<english>Ok</english>

<english>apc one man party in disarray.</english>
<english>Nobody can seal the Lagos state house of assembly complex without the instruction of President Tinubu or his wife or both of them.</english>
<english>What does this teach us .</english> <english>The President can't be seen to be interfering in State matters ...I know the balance of mainland and island have been shifted.</english> <english>Not withstanding let the members decide.</english> <pidgin>Hope his voice is not clone sha.</pidgin> <pidgin>Baba fit dey test A.I voice .</pidgin> <english>There must be a balance between the Islanders and Mainlanders ...</english> <pidgin>that's were the miscalculation takes place, although I understand the pain watching Oga Obasa trying to enjoy three terms ..</pidgin> <pidgin>If the current speaker must resign they should be a gentle lady agreement, make she enjoy the office for three months chop her own , then resign, then a new speaker can then be elected.</pidgin> <english>All this one DSS is doing  is in bad taste for the President's image.</english>
<english>Tinubu is surely behind this.That man is more interested in his interests in Lagos state than seeing to the good of the country.I can no longer support a petty low lifer of a president.High time lagosians acted like men and call this despotof a tyrant's bluff.This is disgusting</english>
<english>The new speaker will resign before the end of today.</english> <english>It's a done deal.</english> <english>Obasa is coming back.</english> <english>Lagos is Tulumbu's property.</english> <english>Nothing anyone can do</english>

<english>The Defence Headquarters has urged Nigerians to disregard the malicious allegations and support the efforts of the armed forces to enhance national security and promote the welfare of servicemen and women.The Director of Defence Information, Brig.-Gen.</english> <english>Tukur Gusau, in a statement on Monday, faulted the allegations regarding Nigerian MilitaryTMs request for visas to attend the Invictus Games in Vancouver, Canada.He urged Nigerians to support the officers, men and women who sustained various degree of injuries while protecting the nation.According to him, the need for accurate information at this time can not be overemphasised.Gusau said the Nigerian military received an invitation to participate in the Invictus Games with its team, that comprised of three officers and 21 players, including the teamTMs physiotherapist.He explained that the Invictus Games Foundation catered for the teamTMs accommodation and feeding needs, along with those of other participating nations.He said, However, inspite of our best efforts, only 14 members of the team, excluding the team leader, captain, and physiotherapist, were granted visas.Regrettably, seven of our athletes who had the potential to excel were denied visas, preventing them from participating in the games.Notwithstanding this setback, our teamTMs outstanding performance earned Nigeria gold, silver and bronze medals, proudly placing our nation and Africa on the global map of Invictus Games.Furthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen.</english> <english>Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.It is on record that the Chief of Defence Staff has initiated laudable efforts to boost morale of our service personnel who risk their lives to protect our nation and its people.The Invictus Foundation Centre, which is the first in Africa and currently under construction, is part of this initiative to provide care and mental healing for our wounded personnel.NAN</english>
<english>Stay in your house and fight insecurity.</english> <english>I support Canada on this.</english> <english>Why are Canadian Generals not begging to come to Nigeria?</english>
<english>You people should stop contradicting yourself.</english>
<english>Just imagine this lame damage control.</english>
<english>Furthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen.</english> <english>Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.The Nigerian government should confirm the number of CDS of other participating countries to know if his presence is necessarily required</english>
<english>Furthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen.</english> <english>Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.So the defence director of sports cant perform this same function except the CDS goes in person?</english>
<english>Damqge control and lies as usual.What is the COAS going to do at the games?</english> <english>Is he a participant?</english> <pidgin>What is his role?So because Nigeria football team is going to America to play a feiendly match, the Nigerian president would follow them just to gibe them a moral boost?Una no get work!</pidgin>
<english>If this is actually what happened, then Canadian embassy would've issued a public apology.</english> <pidgin>Unfortunately, those guys don't have regards for Nigeria.</pidgin> <english>That's why they didn't give a fvck.If not that Nigeria cannot survive without aids from these western countries, the FG would've expelled the Canadian ambassador from Nigeria for this utter disgrace and disrespect.</english>
<english>No matter how paranoid or conspiracy-minded you are, what the Nigerian army and Nigeria government is actually doing is worse than you can ever imagine.</english> <english>The Canadian government knows this.</english>
<english>Damage control?</english>
<english>What's there to disregard?As if the Nigerian army and the federal government have any option.</english>
<english>Furthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen.</english> <english>Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops"...as a sport psychologist that he is?</english>
<english>Are they denying it?</english>
<english>Stay in your house and fight insecurity.</english> <english>I support Canada on this.</english> <english>Why are Canadian Generals not begging to come to Nigeria?I believe U can read.Read the post before commenting</english>
<english>What's there to disregard?As if the Nigerian army and the federal government have any option.This kind of unpatriotic comments are very irritating</english>
<english>Some Nigerians for no good reason derive joy in condemning anything that has to do with their country</english>
<english>Damage control?</english> <english>What is the damage</english>
<english>These people are morons.</english> <pidgin>If they say only 21 people were supposed to go for the games, why then are they saying the presence of the CDS would have made a difference?</pidgin> <english>Is the CDS a cheer leader?</english> <english>Doesn't he have better things to do with his time as CDS?Abegi, this damage is not controlling.</english>
<english>Just imagine this lame damage control.Always complaining about everything</english>
<pidgin>Oga person wey him house dey born no pursue rat stay naija fight boko haram</pidgin>
<english>Next time deny Canada CDS visa in retaliation.By the way, what business has CDS with Invictus game, when BokoHaram is killing our troops?</english>
<pidgin>Hmmmmmmm, they want cover their shame, even their shame dey shame me</pidgin>
<english>Unfortunately We are still under colonial rulesBut this is actually different types of colonialism, it is indirect colonialism.Whereby our leaders are directly colonisedThe colonial masters simply asked them to respond/react by releasing these statements for purposes of damage control when they heard public outcry.</english>
<english>Why are our leaders like this in this country for God sake, when are we going to change, because of Sport game a whole Nigeria General is planning to travel to Canada give the participants a boost to win a Gold medal or.....</english> <english>meanwhile there is a lot of challenges on ground to settle in your country.</english> <english>Canada is perfectly right.</english> <english>Kudos to them.</english>
<english>who's fooling who now?</english>
<pidgin>who is fooling who now?</pidgin>
<english>I know the worst are Nigeria Police Force, National Assembly and EFCC.But these days its like Nigerian Army and DSS are about to join them as the most useless establishments in Nigeria.</english>
<english>Stay in your house and fight insecurity.</english> <english>I support Canada on this.</english> <pidgin>Why are Canadian Generals not begging to come to Nigeria?Good question.They simply want to go there and flex as usual but this time it backfired.Now they have come out to tell us cork and bull story.Dem shoot bird pikin em mama fly</pidgin>
<pidgin>Make the die this matter already.It's not that deep</pidgin>
<english>Furthermore, the participation of the Chief of Defence Staff, Gen.</english> <pidgin>Christopher Musa, would have added mental strength to our troops.It is on record that the Chief of Defence Staff has initiated laudable efforts to boost morale of our service personnel who risk their lives to protect our nation and its people.The CDS didn't go into Sambisa forest to boost the morale of service personnel who are in the heat of battle, but can go for winter games in Canada.Na wah o!</pidgin>
<pidgin>All this our generals don cast, i like as dem dey collect gbas gbos everywhere.</pidgin> <pidgin>Which one be CDS presence to boost troops morale?</pidgin> <pidgin>Una no add to their salaries and welfare to boost their morale, na presence of CDS dem go chop?</pidgin> <english>Nonsense.</english>

<pidgin>Testing a woman for LOYALTY is like testing the Pacific Ocean for SALT.It's POINTLESS!Women do NOT possess the capability to be faithful.Their default setting is SLUTTERY.Don't bother to test your woman's loyalty, she'll ALWAYS fail.A woman could be married to a King and still spread her ass cheeks for the merciless reckoning of a pauper's dicccck.Women have NO FIDELITY!Women have NO DIGNITY!Just ask POTIPHAR.His wife almost RAPED Joseph who was a SLAVE at the time.Even more recently, a FORMER QUEEN has turned herself into a riffraff's (Portable) BIIITCH.See women for what they really are.NEVER  expect loyalty from them.They cannot give what they do NOT have.Expecting loyalty from women is like expecting a homeless BINGO not to eat unsupervised shiiit.It's MADNESS!Personalize it as your woman.When you test any woman and she fails.</pidgin> <english>Just move on.</english> <pidgin>There are 100s of faithful women out there and i am telling you as some one who hacks women's comms device at will.I have seen sluts and i av seen the ones loyal to the core.</pidgin>

<english>No upward age restrictions i think!</english>
<english>Yes, since you desire and can afford it.</english> <pidgin>You could also consider Open University of you don't want to do it full time.</pidgin>
<english>Why not but if you can enroll in part time and focus more on your hustle, you will be happier at the end of everything</english>
<english>Oh Yes!You're definitely not too old to pick up the broken pieces of your life and you're not too advance in years to enrol in a tertiary institution.I'm 29 years old in my third uni, I've lost several years.Good thing is, I'm studying my dream course.But then, I will graduate when I'm about 34 years old.It's never too late to start or to start all over again.</english> <english>It's all just a construct in our minds.</english>
<pidgin>Yes.Don't let anyone discourage you.</pidgin> <english>26 is young.</english>
<english>Yes.,It's never too late</english>
<english>Please it's never too lateChase your dreams to be a graduate</english>
<english>Why not?Even at 50.</english>
<english>You can go to school almost at any age.Life itself is a lesson and we keep learning everyday.Just go to school.</english>
<english>You can be a graduate without taking Jamb.</english> <english>Register for Jamb and enrol in an open University</english>
<english>in the heart of Lagos exists a saloon and boutique where the staff are all first class degree holders.</english> <english>The categories of workers includes; gate man, cleaner, stylist, cashier, supervisor, etc.Wonders shall never end.</english>
<pidgin>I don't know how to upload a video direct, l would have done so, you can follow up the link to watch the video.</pidgin>
<english>If she is not first class or second class upper then it is to spite them.The joy some people have denigrating first class because they did not put in effort to get it.Or maybe out of goodwill.Or maybe taking the best from the rest.</english>
<english>...The pay must be super handsome.</english> <pidgin>But then again, this is nigeria, most things rarely make sense here</pidgin>
<english>Educational abuse</english>
<english>Pk</english>
<english>First class in mass communication from a Polytechnic!</english> <english>When did polytechnics start issuing grades as first class?Moreover, having a first class doesnTMt really mean you are the smartest in your class.</english> <english>ItTMs just that you cram more or have more time to warm your books than others.All the so called employees in that video look mentally unstable.</english> <english>Seems sheTMd already used their brains.</english>
<pidgin>And so?</pidgin> <pidgin>These are crafts that make people rich in developed countries.I don't understand the need to upload this video though.Is he trying to make gatemen and cleaners look less employed or what?These are people doing honest jobs that will take them to heaven after their earthly lives.</pidgin> <pidgin>They decided to keep it clean rather than soil their lives for millions.I am not saying they can't be better in life.</pidgin> <english>But every one cannot be a millionaire or billionaire.</english> <english>Everyone cannot be in management.I have seen wheel barrow pushers build mansions.</english> <english>All they needed was a plan and a target.Coscharis motors that is the biggest distributor of German cars in Nigeria barely finished grade 6.He even doubles as the board of chairman of 2 investment banks in Nigeria.Degrees are just papers.</english> <english>What matters is output.</english> <english>What did you produce with your degree.The problem we have in Nigeria is that we have put so much focus and attention on paper certificates that produces nothing.</english>
<english>Insecurity from a bitter soul is all I see here.She's trying to ridicle those wit first class degree.</english> <english>Her type graduated wit 3rd class or pass and swore to employ the so called "first class graduates".</english> <pidgin>We no their type.</pidgin> <pidgin>Na bad belle.</pidgin>
<pidgin>InterestingI don't know what informed the owner's decision to employ only first class holders for jobs that need little or no education.</pidgin> <pidgin>But I am   % sure school no be scam</pidgin>
<english>When you're "Theorical" first class graduate, that's bound to happen...</english> <english>If they were practical they could have used that knowledge to start something.Nevertheless, this could be their little beginning, we all have our little beginning if we were not fortunate to be born into fortune.</english>
<pidgin>Wonders shall never size</pidgin>
<english>.</english>

<english>Maybe first class from National Open University...</english>
<pidgin>Don't rely on Nigeria as a graduate, otherwise you'll die of depression if you do.</pidgin>
<english>Nonesense.An authentic first class graduate will not do 'gate man' work.</english> <english>It is a total waste of knowledge.This is a big lie.</english> <english>How will they even see a first class graduate apply for such</english>
<pidgin>No be only first class graduates, na last class graduates.</pidgin>
<pidgin>E fit be Alaba Nwa Boy, wey serve him oga for 8 years go own the Salon and boutique.</pidgin>
<english>Anyone with first class who works there doesn't deserve that grade or is an extreme case of book smart but zero street OT.</english> <pidgin>The owner of the place sef which grade does she have?With all the first class people she is humiliating to work there in her salon they can't give her first class face?</pidgin> <english>Why is she carrying first class ugliness around and calling it a face?</english>
<english>This one get beef with first class students when she was a student in school, reason for her action.</english>
<english>I biliv those people bought their first class.Perhaps, as a result of village people.No where to work again, but cleaner and gateman, can't you go and learn hairdressing or tailoring instead.</english>
<english>Maybe first class from National Open University...Are you better than graduates from Noun?</english>
<english>If you believe this shit, then you will believe anything</english>
<pidgin>lubbish saida boj kind of lady</pidgin>
<english>And so?</english>
<pidgin>Nothing concern me but E dey mindI wish Helinues will apply but na only common entrance he get</pidgin>
<pidgin>Chairman Nigeria which way?</pidgin>
<english>E</english>

<pidgin>The lady intentionally recruited them (though they don't  give the vibes of  First Class quality) to prove a point that she can diminish and spite what graduating with a First Class, represents......a reflection of her insecurity.</pidgin>
<english>What is bad about it....</english> <english>It's better than to be idol</english>
<english>Amid his clash with VeryDarkMan (VDM), DeeOne donates money to VDM's NGO to support one of VDM'S humanitarian projects, urges others to donate.</english>

<english>Madness</english>
<english>There's no much difference between this Deeone and Nairaland Jennyclay.</english> <english>Unfortunate attention seekers!</english>
<english>This goes to show Nedu was the target</english>
<pidgin>This guy na really anywhere belle face.</pidgin> <english>Wants to trend by all means</english>
<english>I detest humans that seek attention like its some oxygen needed for their useless existenceShame on him</english>
<pidgin>$6, e no easy</pidgin>
<english>10k?like 5.26 pounds or $6.62!</english>
<english>He's confused</english>
<english>The fear of VDM the beginning of wisdom to this yeyebrities.</english> <english>Their knees bows before VeryDarkMan himself</english>
<english>Alright</english>
<pidgin>this guy na clown ..a really broke clown</pidgin>
<english>He's been compromised.</english> <english>VDM is a suspect.Inasmuch as i like VDM, his dressing especially that useless singlet has always been repugnant to me .</english> <pidgin>As a straight man, i will never hug a Nigga wearing that nonsense singlet.Looks gayey to me</pidgin>
<english>Lol....wonder what he's upto.....But anyways, kudos to him for his support and God bless him...!!</english>
<pidgin>He who the gods want to destroy, they first make him mad.</pidgin>
<pidgin>Attention seeker....VDM no go still give am ah swear</pidgin>
<english>Hope everything from the onset, wasnTMt clout chasing to force his name to our remembrance again?</english>
<english>Dee One</english>
<english>Nonsense</english>
<english>This guy is becoming over boring.</english>
<pidgin>Nigger be looking for attention like his life depends on it..Na why we dey pray make God pick our calls, so that the people who neglected or underrated us will come begging for attention..When the nigger was in his prime, I believe VDM was nowhere to be found, but today tables don turn.</pidgin> <english>If I were VDM, I would continue to ignore him as he's as irrelevant as the "p" in psychology...</english>
<pidgin>All of you should  getat with your useless fight wey no get head</pidgin>
<english>Evil always contains the seeds of its own destruction.</english> <english>It is ultimately negative, and therefore encompasses its downfall even at its moments of apparent triumph.</english> <english>No matter how grandiose, how well-planned, how apparently foolproof of an evil plan, the inherent sinfulness will by definition rebound upon its instigators.</english> <english>No matter how apparently successful it may seem upon the way, at the end it will wreck itself.</english>
<pidgin>When we here donate, do u think there is an actual amount incured on it?...even 2k is part of a very big donation....If person donate 10millon  and another donate 200k, both sha donate sometin........So him donate 10k,him try nae reach to take subscribe</pidgin>
<pidgin>Yeyebrities all fighting for their pockets.VDM, Nedu, Deeone and the rest are all yeyebrities</pidgin>
<pidgin>DeeOne just dey catch cruise, no need to take him serious.</pidgin>
<english>This one is craving VDM attention like mad</english>
<pidgin>he for do am 1k</pidgin>
<english>Some Nigerians who live abroad now get lesson teachers for their kids from Nigeria to help boost their children's grades in school.The lesson is done online via zoom.What do you think about this kind of style?</english>
<english>This is good</english>
<english>ItTMs primarily because itTMs cheaper</english>
<english>What do I know?</english>
<english>Nigerians have ways of simplifying complex ideas theoretically that a two-year old will understand.</english> <pidgin>But the practical that's on a long thing.So Nigerians in the diaspora are getting the theory explained by Nigerian teachers and the practical will be done in the abroad where they are residing.If you ask me, that's a two factor assurance - so brilliant.</pidgin> <english>That way the child will be good at both the theory and practical.</english>
<english>APC has failed Nigerians.</english>
<english>It's a really good idea..Investing in kids future is a great asset.</english>
<english>ItTMs primarily because itTMs cheaperBut it increases job opportunity and improves financial status of whoever wants to do the job.Learn how to use ur mouth positive and  not only for negative and character assassinations........</english> <english>if you want to go far in life.You guys would complain and wailing about Naija situation, the same people would quickly jump to conderm any act of improving the nation building.</english> <english>What else you want!</english>
<english>ItTMs primarily because itTMs cheaperor free self</english>
<english>ItTMs a welcome idea.</english> <english>I have people who do that, for itTMs cheaper and brings our moral values to the children because the online teachers teach as if they are teaching in Nigerian settings.</english>
<english>Cheap labour</english>
<english>To teach indigenous languages or what?</english>
<english>I did this while I was in Nigeria.</english> <english>I prepared a kid in year five for his Primary checkpoint English and his elder brother for his GCSE.</english> <english>And I often prepared others for IELTS.</english> <english>The pay was reasonable considering the exchange rate and it was even more affordable for the parents as they're not obligated to pay minimum wage.</english> <english>So it's a win win!</english>
<english>That's nonsense</english>
<english>Some Nigerians who live abroad now get lesson teachers for their kids from Nigeria to help boost their children's grades in school.The lesson is done online via zoom.What do you think about this kind of style?They will be paying the person based on Nigeria price .</english> <english>I have a friend doing it for someone in UK</english>
<english>only for Igbo language would i engage a teacher living in nigeria.dont birth children if you cant afford their education wherever you reside.Imagine letting a Nigerian teach my children useless cut-and-join Nigerian English</english>
<english>Another way Nigerian Teachers can cash out</english>
<english>Alright.</english>
<pidgin>Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria.</pidgin> <english>I understand you might not have lived outside Nigeria, so I have no problem with your views.Most schools abroad encourage mediocrity and non ambitious learning.</english> <english>Many Nigerians see this gap and decide that their own child will not join the bandwagon of mediocrity and so get a teacher from Nigeria who will help push the child better with a Nigerian driven curriculum.Why do you think Nigerians top classes in UK schools for example?</english>
<pidgin>Money for zoom data alone na dieWell.</pidgin> <pidgin>Laslas.</pidgin> <english>Our teachers will use technology to impact knowledge.Hope d pay is sweet oo.</english> <pidgin>Make dem no come dey use 100k for data and then pay tutors 15k per month ooo</pidgin>
<english>Very good.</english> <english>One thing I love about we Nigerians is our educational system.</english> <english>Thorough teachings alongside heavy workloads from various subject and that's the reason you see them go to other countries and become their best students there</english>
<pidgin>Please am interested.</pidgin>
<english>So that you pay him 20k, very wicked peopleOya gettat arraherrrr</english>
<pidgin>To the good of our economy in Nigeria.But I don't really see the effectiveness of it as one done physically there.</pidgin> <english>After all, the western cultured children can't take our system of learning.Maybe those parents just want to save cost</english>
<pidgin>Make the teachers remit tax to government o!</pidgin>
<english>I think it's a welcome development.</english> <pidgin>This will even make our Nigerian children to top their classes.</pidgin>
<english>It's been going for a while now.As we speak I have 2 students I teach online and its going on fine.</english> <english>Its just that you must know your onions and be ready to adapt because of differences in the curricula of the two countries involved.</english> <english>You may also need to spend money to get the necessary materials like the recommended texts and past questions.</english>
<pidgin>Moreover, it's a way some teachers earn a bit more to augment poor pay from school.You'll be shocked to know that some of these teachers make more than their salary doing this and for just about 3hrs a week.Sometimes the children are grouped in classes which means the teacher can earn even more.Those saying because it's cheaper don't realise that the driver for doing this is the high quality of education in Nigeria.</pidgin> <english>I understand you might not have lived outside Nigeria, so I have no problem with your views.Most schools abroad encourage mediocrity and non ambitious learning.</english> <english>Many Nigerians see this gap and decide that their own child will not join the bandwagon of mediocrity and so get a teacher from Nigeria who will help push the child better with a Nigerian driven curriculum.Why do you think Nigerians top classes in UK schools for example?</english>
<english>only for Igbo language would i engage a teacher living in nigeria.dont birth children if you cant afford their education wherever you reside.Imagine letting a Nigerian teach my children useless cut-and-join Nigerian EnglishThis is by far the most preposterous comment so far on this thread.</english> <pidgin>It is only a ludicrous person that'd say Nigerian Teachers teach cut and join English, when it is conspicuous that we have several English Language Teachers that know their onions.</pidgin> <english>Some of us that didn't study English language and aren't English language Teachers can even teach the Language well to a good extent.</english>
<english>Residents of Tudun Murtala Tagarji community in Kano State woke up to a distressing discovery of a newborn baby abandoned in a carton near the Kaura drainage.According to Commander Sulaiman Rabiu, leader of the Operation Zaman Lafiya vigilante group, his team came across the heartbreaking scene during a routine patrol around 2 a.m.</english> <english>on Saturday.Yesterday around 2 a.m., while we were out on patrol, we came across a shocking incident inside a pit very close to us.</english> <english>Upon close observation, we noticed a disposed carton, but we had no idea what was inside it, he recounted.Determined to investigate, the team proceeded with caution.In order to clear our doubt and be sure nothing harmful was kept there, I instructed my boys to open the carton, and behold, upon opening it, we saw a baby already dead, Sulaiman revealed.Following the discovery, the vigilantes took the baby to their office and informed the community leadership.By morning, we invited the ward head to come and see for himself, along with other members of the community, before conveying the baby to the police station and informing them, he explained.The police later directed them to a hospital for medical examination, where doctors confirmed the baby was dead.We came back home and organized burial rites for the baby in accordance with Islamic teachings, Sulaiman stated.Commander Sulaiman urged vigilante groups to remain vigilant in safeguarding their communities and called on parents to guide their children, particularly young women, to avoid circumstances leading to unwanted pregnancies.Unwanted pregnancy goes against Islamic teachings, and parents should monitor their childrenTMs movements, with guidance from traditional leaders, he advised.</english>

<pidgin>UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is "ready and willing" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the UK prime minister said securing a lasting peace in Ukraine was "essential if we are to deter Putin from further aggression in the future".Before attending an emergency summit with European leaders in Paris on Monday, Sir Keir said the UK was prepared to contribute to security guarantees to Ukraine by "putting our own troops on the ground if necessary"."I do not say that lightly," he wrote.</pidgin> <pidgin>"I feel very deeply the responsibility that comes with potentially putting British servicemen and women in harm's way."The prime minister "But any role in helping to guarantee Ukraine's security is helping to guarantee the security of our continent, and the security of this country."The end of Russia's war with Ukraine "when it comes, cannot merely become a temporary pause before Putin attacks again", Sir Keir said.UK troops could be deployed alongside soldiers from other European nations alongside the border between Ukrainian-held and Russian-held territory.Sir Keir's announcement comes after the former head of the Army, Lord Dannatt, told the BBC the UK military was "so run down" it could not lead any future peacekeeping mission in Ukraine.The PM has previously only hinted that British troops could be involved in safeguarding Ukraine after a ceasefire.He is due to visit President Donald Trump in Washington later this month and said a "US security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace, because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again".Sir Keir is meeting with other European leaders in response to concerns the US is moving forward with Russia on peace talks that will lock out the continent.US Secretary of State Marco Rubio plans to meet Russian officials in Saudi Arabia in the coming days, US officials say.On Saturday the US special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, said European leaders would be consulted only and not take part in any talks between the US and Russia.A senior Ukrainian government source told the BBC on Sunday that Kyiv has not been invited to talks between the US and Russia.Trump earlier this week announced he had had a lengthy conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and that negotiations to stop the "ridiculous war" in Ukraine would begin "immediately".Trump then "informed" Zelensky of his plan.On Sunday, Trump said that he expected Zelensky to be involved in the talks.</pidgin> <english>He also said he would allow European nations to buy US weapons for Ukraine.Asked by the BBC about his timetable for an end to fighting, Trump said only that "we're working to get it done" and laid the blame for the war on the previous administration's Ukraine policies.Writing in the Telegraph, Sir Keir said "peace cannot come at any cost" and "Ukraine must be at the table in these negotiations, because anything less would accept Putin's position that Ukraine is not a real nation".He "We cannot have another situation like Afghanistan, where the US negotiated directly with the Taliban and cut out the Afghan government - in reference to a deal negotiated by Trump's first administration, which was later enacted by the Biden administration."I feel sure that President Trump will want to avoid this too," said Sir KeirSir Keir said Ukraine's path to Nato membership was "irreversible" and European nations "must increase our defence spending and take on a greater role" in the alliance.The UK currently spends around 2.3% of GDP on defence and has committed to increase defence spending to a 2.5% share of the economy, without giving a timeframe for this.Trump has called for Nato members to spend 5% of GDP on defence, while Nato secretary general Mark Rutte has suggested allies should spend more than 3%.Lord Dannatt - who was head of the Army from 2006 to 2009 - told the BBC up to 40,000 UK troops would be needed for a peacekeeping mission in Ukraine and "we just haven't got that number available".He said, in total, a force to keep the peace would require about 100,000 troops and the UK would have to supply "quite a proportion of that and we really couldn't do it".The meeting in Paris called by French President Emmanuel Macron will see Sir Keir joined by leaders from Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark along with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, and Rutte.</english>
<english>UK should thread with caution, though I understand their frustration with Donald trump and wanting to save face, they've been humiliated by the orange man in the white houseI think this is a wake up call and opportunity for Europe to break away from US and build their own army</english>

<english>Sending troops to a war torn area this late in the game while there are peace talks underway very odd</english>
<english>Desperation...</english> <english>Accept your defeat.</english>
<english>A potentially interesting turn of events.</english> <english>Since 1945, the UK has not had reason to oppose Russia on the battle field.</english> <english>Now, we are faced with a potential situation that may very well escalate.</english> <english>Now can the UK force project?</english> <english>That's unlikely as it has limited blue water navy capabilities.</english> <english>Can UK troops in Ukraine be a game changer?</english> <english>Certainly not in the way we'd like to think.</english> <english>Their presence there is just a trip wire that will draw in larger European forces.Emmanuel Macron is chomping at the bits to commit troops to Ukraine.</english> <english>Germany is heeing and hawing but will eventually commit.</english> <english>However, the situation needed not have gotten to this extent.</english> <english>The United States abdicating its responsibilities is what is forcing these countries to step up.The meeting in France today will be very interesting.</english>
<english>That makes me nervous .Am not supporting any side in this war, but Europeans getting involved brings us one step closer to WW3</english>

<english>Let see how Europe's going to manage their world of dominance without US.</english> <english>Trump is nailing them to their place and seek friendship from the ach-rival Russia, Trump will humble European for his 4years in office</english>
<english>Why does this sound funny...</english> <english>Maybe in history UK might have had a strong army, but since we entered the 21st century, I've never pictured UK as having soldiers not to talk of being strong enough to even fight any nation...</english> <pidgin>Somehow, I just believe they don't have balls (might be wrong sha)</pidgin>

<english>Minister of Marine and Blue Economy,Adegboyega Oyetola has urged Governor Ademola Adeleke of Osun State to respect the Appeal Court judgement that reinstated the sacked local government chairmen in the state.Oyetola also dismissed AdelekeTMs claims of plotting the breakdown of law and order in the state.OSUN DEFENDER reports that the Governor while addressing a World Press Conference on Sunday had alleged his predecessor of plotting to destabilise the state.Adeleke said Oyetola was planning to use security agencies to create chaos and anarchy in Osun state over the judgement of the Appeal Court on the sacked elected Yes or No Chairmen.But, in a statement by the Media Office of the minister, a copy of which was made available to journalists on Sunday, Oyetola said he is a man of peace who has tremendous respect for the judiciary, rule of law and constituted authority, as such would never be party to any breakdown of law and order.For the four years he governed Osun, he gave a good account of himself as a man of peace, a respecter of rule of law and one not given to violence.</english> <english>If he is given to violence, he would certainly have fought back violently in 2022 when was brazenly rigged out.Again, in 2022, when Governor Ademola Adeleke employed extra-judicial means to sack democratically elected council officials, Oyetola as the leader of party, never preached violence.</english> <english>Instead, he led the party members to court.Thankfully, his party won at the Appeal last week.</english> <english>And as peace-loving leader, he appealed to security agencies to enforce the judgement of the court.</english> <english>How can such a man be accused of a destabilisation plot.</english> <english>I think anyone accusing Oyetola of violence needs to have his/her head properly examined.The minister, is further seizing this opportunity to appeal to his successor to respect the Appeal Court judgement, rather than resort to cheap blackmail, which has no place in law, the statement reads in part.</english>
<english>Adeleke clueless press conference doesnTMt hold any water here.</english> <english>Adeleke and his party Pdp are goners</english>
<english>Adeleke and Oyetola should grow up</english>
<english>What is the exact position of the Appeal Court judgement?</english> <english>Did the court truly order the reinstatement of the Council Chairmen or no consequential order was given as claimed by the governor?Those with better understanding of the judgement should enlighten the rest of us.</english>
<pidgin>Thank God  the rascality begins and end within themselvesIs normalAbeg make una burn and kill all..</pidgin> <english>who cares?Nigerians has moved ahead with the Yoruba government induced hardshipAll the persons that might die in this their fight no see pass 5kTinubu dealing with his peopleAnd them clapping and singing his praises</english>
<english>What is the exact position of the Appeal Court judgement?</english> <pidgin>Did the court truly order the reinstatement of the Council Chairmen or no consequential order was given as claimed by the governor?Those with better understanding of the judgement should enlighten the rest of us.Why you no go confuseThis people eh..</pidgin>
<pidgin>OK ,Don't destabilize any one making progress ,mostly for the good of the people ,like our role model Princess Faith ChukwuPrincess Faith Chukwu</pidgin>

<english>Osun people are still confused about their political terrain.</english> <english>Adeleke is the governor but Oyetola wants to hijack it while Aregbesola wants to scatter everything.</english>
<english>DonTMt o</english>
<english>This is a big mess!</english>
<english>..</english>
<english>Why not concentrate on your blue economy ministry and come up.</english> <english>with what to tell Nigerians as your achievements?Adeleke': Why not stop dancing around and concentrate on administering your state.</english> <pidgin>Perhaps, go to Fubara on the blue print on how to fight a Minister?Osun God go deliver una.</pidgin>
<english>politicians will not stop amazing us.</english> <english>Osun defender is telling the side of the story that suits them.</english> <english>See the The court in a judgment in Tuesday ordered the immediate resumption of office of the council officials who are all members of the All Progressives Congress, APC.Meanwhile, the Osun State Independent Electoral Commission, OSSIEC, has filed an appeal against the Appeal Court judgement.The government filed an application for stay of execution, pending hearing of the appeal.DAILY POST recalls that on assumption of office in November 2022, Governor Adeleke sacked the local government officials after a High Court decision had earlier upturned their election.The High Court sacked the council officials after their election which was organised by OSSIEC.The Osun State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and other political parties had approached the High Court to challenge the council elections.They prayed the court to declare the election as a nullity because it was only the APC candidates who contested vacant positions and the  options given to them was either a YES or NOTM."Based on this newspaper information, there is an appeal of that judgement and stay of execution in place at the court.So why is Oyetola and his APC team in a hurry?</english> <english>Be calm and see it through at the courts.</english>
<pidgin>Thank God  the rascality begins and end within themselvesIs normalAbeg make una burn and kill all..</pidgin> <english>who cares?Nigerians has moved ahead with the Yoruba government induced hardshipAll the persons that might die in this their fight no see pass 5kTinubu dealing with his peopleAnd them clapping and singing his praisesAnother mentally unstable youth</english>
<english>Who are we to believe?</english> <english>Adeleke in his statement claimed that the removal was done at the tenure of the same Oyetola.</english> <pidgin>Now Oyetola has turned around to say that Adeleke used extra judicial means to remove the council chairmen.Are we expecting another Rivers state in Osun state?</pidgin>
<english>Oyetola is still pained for loosing election.the weakling should wait for the next election and try his luck.</english>

<english>The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control has intensified its enforcement efforts against the sale of illicit and counterfeit pharmaceuticals, sealing over 3,000 shops within the Idumota Open Drug Market in Lagos in the first week of operations.This was made known in a statement shared on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday by NAFDAC.During the raid, officials uncovered alarming violations, including vaccines stored in dilapidated, unventilated rooms sealed with iron sheets, posing severe health risks.Large consignments of banned and dangerous drugs were also discovered, including Analgin injections, diverted HIV antiretroviral drugs, and expired medicines slated for illegal revalidation.The statement said,"In the first week of enforcement, NAFDAC screened and sealed over 3,000 shops within the Idumota Open Drug Market in Lagos."Among the discoveries were vaccines stored in dilapidated, unventilated rooms sealed with iron sheets in highly unsanitary conditions."Additionally, large consignments of banned products, including Analgin injections, diverted-free HIV antiretroviral drugs, expired medicines set for revalidation, and unregistered pharmaceuticals, were found."We have evacuated illicit pharmaceuticals equivalent to 12 truckloads."Empty packs and cartons of expired unregistered antimalarial injections were discovered inside a packing shop.</english> <english>The vials were removed."#HappeningNowEcstasy (MDMA or Molly), various brands of Codeine Cough Syrup and Tramadol 225, were discovered in a warehouse within the market, away from the pharmaceutical section where other products are sold."The enforcement operation is part of NAFDACTMs renewed commitment to sanitising the countryTMs drug distribution system and curbing the proliferation of counterfeit and dangerous medications, the agency said.Nlfpmod</english>

<pidgin>lawmaker representing Borno South Senatorial District, Ali Ndume, has asked the Federal Government to probe a claim by US Congressman Scott Perry that aborted United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded terrorist organisations, including Boko Haram.You canTMt say itTMs just an allegation; itTMs more than that, the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Army said on Channels TelevisionTMs Sunday Politics programme.ThatTMs why the Nigerian government and the National Assembly, especially, need to look into it to investigate and verify the veracity of such a very weighty allegation.The lawmaker, who has been in the National Assembly for more than 20 unbroken years, said the Nigerian government should be interested in the US congressmanTMs revelation, considering that there had been suspicions that foreign humanitarian agencies operating in NigeriaTMs insurgent-ridded North-East zone sponsored terrorist activities.Ndume said, This development is very worrisome, especially because one of the terrorist organisations mentioned by Scott Perry is Boko Haram, and Boko Haram has ravaged not only the North-East but even (other parts of) Nigeria.You can remember Boko Haram bombed the police headquarters and the UN office in Abuja, and the casualties were enormous.</pidgin> <english>So, the Nigerian government must be interested.ITMm worried, but the Nigerian security agencies have raised this indirectly several times.</english> <english>Even the Borno State government was wary of the operations of the NGOs.I remember during the period of (Lieutenant General Tukur) Buratai, the Nigerian Army got intelligence and even raided the office of USAID or United Nations in Maiduguri.</english> <english>There was also a time when the governor got intelligence and security agencies raided one NGO that was providing training to some of their staff on how to use guns.We have been wondering for all these years where these people are getting money.Ndume further said Nigeria should be giving out humanitarian assistance to other countries and not receiving them.This issue of relying on aid from other countries is not even good for us because Nigeria, by now, is supposed to be the one that is giving out aid and not receiving aid, he said.This is like a wake-up for all of us in government.</english> <english>We have everything; the only problem is the leadership.</english> <english>We need to fix that so that weTMll tap into what we have and be content.</english>

<english>Hmm</english>
<english>Ok</english>
<english>You will not see Peter Obi saying anything about this.</english> <pidgin>Very devish man</pidgin>
<english>You will not see Peter Obi saying anything about this.</english> <english>Very devish manAhhh...time to masturbate with PO's name.</english> <english>Your daily dose done and dusted.</english> <english>Hope you ejaculating stones?...foooool...</english>

<english>The North sponsored bokoharam!</english>
<english>Telling Criminal to probe Criminal</english>
<english>They wouldnTMt probe because theyTMre also part of the weighty allegation</english>
<english>When it started, it was all fun until it became a menace.</english> <english>If everyone in every northern commjnity becomes a whistle blower like in the SW, BH will not stay</english>
<pidgin>OKif you kill innocent people who did nothing wrong to you,you will die too ,Say no crime ,Princess Faith Chukwu</pidgin>
<pidgin>You need to listen to what the US rep said before you misconstrue.He said the US still gives taliban money, and assistance for women who the country donTMt even allow to talkHe said how do you expect that money to be used for aid in Afghanistan when a terrorist and bin ladinTMs son are in charge?</pidgin> <english>He said the money will likely be used by the taliban to fund Boko haram and other terrorist groups</english>
<english>We shall see</english>
<english>You will not see Peter Obi saying anything about this.</english> <english>Very devish manYou should be worried about your father inability to provide for his family not Peter Obi your nightmare.</english>
<english>You will not see Peter Obi saying anything about this.</english> <pidgin>Very devish man</pidgin>
<english>You will not see Peter Obi saying anything about this.</english> <english>Very devish manSee what hatred has done to you.</english> <pidgin>There is still a chance to live a normal hate-free man, don't let your life go to waste like this.</pidgin> <english>I take it that you are still young.</english>
<english>They sometimes blatantly admits that they create terrorist groups.</english> <english>Americans are arrogant.</english> <english>Jonathan said it that the level of interference by the Obama Government was overwhelming.</english> <english>Obama even tell Nigerians to vote for new chapter while refused to sell weapons to Jonathan going to the extents of sending US Secretary of State to visit Bihari just before election.</english> <english>One may Wonder what is US benefiting from all these and why Africa can't have good leaders</english>
<english>There could be truth in this.</english> <pidgin>Cos there's no way for a rag tag terrorist to sustain operations for more than 15 years non stop if funding is not coming from someone</pidgin>
<pidgin>Like every other things you probe in nigeria, please don't waste our money, blaming the USA is not going to solve anything</pidgin>
<english>The North sponsored bokoharam!Grow up, they fought 15years with Sophisticated weapons they definitely received foreign funding and Intel from a sophisticated military power in the world</english>
<english>Even terrorists wants to claim innocent</english>
<english>Is it not same Ndume Jonathan dragged to court for sponsorship of Boko Haram?</english> <english>He is reacting to the USAID allegations because in a way the thing will affect him.</english> <english>Bunch of unrepentant terrorists</english>
<pidgin>I am even surprised Northern Elites are not talking about it or demand for accountability from our government except Ndume now</pidgin>
<english>Probe it</english>
<english>The druggie will not like this submission</english>

<english>Where are the people (especially Christians) championing Muslims are terrorists?It has been said that Boko haram were killing Christians.Now US is the main sponsor.Why are they not calling out US?Hypocrites!</english>
<english>If you like delude yourself that its the USAID.</english> <english>Did you see any Americans among the bokoharam members you've been pardoning as repentant?Grow up</english>
<english>The US government believe in one terrible hegemonic policy, That policy is if a country grow to a certain level, it will challenge their power.This is the reason why they have issues with China, because China is fast becoming more powerful than the US.It is glaring to the blind that they destabilize a lot nations in order to hinder their growth.God bless Nigeria</english>

<english>Director General of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, has asked African leaders to look inward for funding opportunities for the continent.Access to aid, I think we can begin to think of it as a thing of the past, the former Nigerian finance minister said at the headquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.According to the ex-World Bank developmental economist, Africa really needs to change its mindset and see opportunities with the seeming challenge and effect of the pause of billions of dollars in global funding for United StatesTM health and education projects in countries of the world.Okonjo-Iweala said African leaders must attract investment and mobilise resources to survive contemporary social and economic realities that come with the policies of the Donald Trump presidency.</english>

<english>Amazing</english>
<english>Common man does not know anything like aid exist in this government.</english> <english>Let all forms of aid stop, those who steal from it will cry more on our behalf because they have been enjoying them on our behalf.</english>

<english>A step in the right direction.Long overdue!</english> <english>.African leaders only use these aids to get free money to squander.</english>
<english>For over 3 decades that I've been on earth, I've only been hearing about USAID, I never imagine that the government of Nigeria are also receiving  it.So my question is, who are the beneficiaries?</english> <english>The government or the the people?.Huh, in a working country, the citizens must hold their neck for more explanation</english>

<english>Poor African countries need aids but Nigeria is not a poor country we are only poorly managed and corrupt.African leaders must be held accountable from now.</english>
<english>Its over</english>

<english>The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps on Sunday warned the Nigeria Labour Congress against its planned March 1 shutdown of telecommunication services in response to the recent 50 per cent tariff hike.The Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria and the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria similarly pushed back against the NLCTMs planned boycott of telecom services and shutdown of telecom infrastructure, arguing that such actions are misguided and could harm the industry.The spokesman for the NSCDC, Babawale Afolabi, in a chat with The PUNCH on Sunday, said the agency had deployed operatives to the base stations to prevent any illegal action by the protesters.The NSCDC, tasked with protecting critical national infrastructure, including telecommunications, expressed concerns over the potential risks the NLC action could pose to national security and public safety.The NLC announced its intention to shut down the operations of telecommunications companies across the country if the tariff hike announced by the Nigerian Communications Commission was not reversed by the end of February.The union directed Nigerians to boycott the services of major telecom providers, including MTN, Airtel, and Glo, daily between 11am and 2pm starting February 13 and continuing through the month.The NLC in a communiqu signed by its President, Joe Ajaero and General Secretary, Emma Ugboaja, accused the telecom operators of breaching public trust by implementing the tariff hike before the conclusion of a 10-man review panelTMs deliberations.The union also faulted the government for failing to protect citizens from corporate exploitation.The NLC argued that the tariff increase represented a betrayal of public trust, given the earlier agreement to establish a committee to review the proposed hike.However, the NSCDC urged the NLC to reconsider its planned protest, warning that any disruption to telecom services could expose the country to criminal activities and compromise national security.Afolabi made it clear that the agency will not allow any action that could jeopardise the security of the nation.He revealed that state commandants had been directed to maintain round-the-clock surveillance at telecom facilities, with a nationwide deployment of officers, including undercover operatives, to ensure the protection of these assets.Citing the importance of telecommunications to national security, the corps warned that any disruption could result in vandalism and other criminal activities.He added, Already, the NSCDC commandant-general has directed state commandants to maintain round-the-clock surveillance in and around all the telecom masts in their locations.Also, there is going to be nationwide massive deployment of the officers and men of the corps, including undercover and intelligence operatives, to maintain peace and ensure that all the government and corporate organisationsTM critical national assets and infrastructure are protected from the miscreants who might likely use the opportunity of the planned protest to carry out their criminal activities.TMTMAvailable credible intelligence already established the fact that the planned protest will be hijacked by hoodlums and that is why the NSCDC is on top of the situation, he further stated.The NSCDC called for dialogue to resolve the dispute and hoped that the NLC would reconsider its stance.Afolabi stated, The NSCDC, under the leadership of Commandant-General, Dr.</english> <english>Ahmed Audi, is appealing to the organized labour under the umbrella of the Nigeria Labour Congress to shelve their planned protest of March 01, 2025 and the move to shut down telecommunication facilities nationwide.Although peaceful protests are allowed under the law, experience and fallouts of similar threats in the past necessitate the need to appeal to the NLC not to embark on any action that will further affect the security of the country.NSCDC will not fold its arms and allow any action that will expose the nationTMs security and eventual compromised economic stability and public safety, under the guise of protesting the increase in telecom services tariffs.The scars of similar protests that turned violent in the past are still there as reference points and the NSCDC and other security agencies in the country will not allow the miscreants, hoodlums and other non-state actors to hide under the guise of NLC protest to loot and vandalise government and corporate organisations assets and infrastructure.The NSCDC stressed its commitment to safeguarding the nationTMs critical infrastructure and stated that it is prepared to take decisive legal action against those who attempt to undermine the security of the country.The NSCDC is committed to safeguarding the lives of Nigerians and property of the government and corporate organizations we are ready to take decisive actions against any individual or group that embarks on any action that can jeopardise the security architecture of the country, he added.The corps said it has placed its personnel on high alert and warned that anyone found engaging in illegal activities during the protest will be dealt with according to the law.We still believe that dialogue remains the best solution and we hope that organised labour will listen to the voice of reason and jaw-jaw with the government.</english> <english>We advise organised labour leaders to stay away from base stations and telecom mast locations as NSCDC personnel have been placed on red alert.Anybody found wanting will be dealt with according to the stipulated law of the country, the spokesperson cautioned.The Private Telecommunications and Communications Senior Staff Association of Nigeria criticised the NLC over its planned protest.The Secretary-General of PTECSSAN, Abdullahi Okonu, told The PUNCH on Sunday that the union had already made its position clear, arguing that the increase is necessary to prevent a collapse of the industry.In a letter addressed to the NLC, PTECSSAN said the labour congress had acted in error by taking decisions without consulting the union, which represents workers in the telecom sector.It is our firm belief that the Congress Leadership has acted in error in taking these decisions without prior consultation with our union that operates in the sector, the letter read.Perhaps, getting in touch with us to provide you with information on the happenings in the sector would have assisted the Leadership in taking a better decision than it had taken, it further said.The union acknowledged the concerns over the impact of the tariff increase on consumers but insisted that the hike was unavoidable due to rising operational costs.PTECSSAN pointed to the removal of fuel subsidy and the subsequent surge in petroleum prices, which have significantly increased the cost of maintaining telecom base stations across the country.On its part, the Association of Telecommunications Companies of Nigeria urged the labour unions to suspend its planned rally, pointing out that there had been no formal engagements or discussions with the telecom operators before the unionTMs decision.ATCON president Tony Emoekpere criticised the planned boycott of telecom services and shutdown of infrastructure declared by the workersTM union.This isnTMt a labour issue; itTMs an industry-wide challenge.</english> <english>Interest rates, for example, fluctuate constantly, yet banks donTMt shut down in protest.</english> <english>These economic policies affect all sectors, not just telecoms.</english> <english>So why single out our industry?</english> <english>Emoekpere told The PUNCH.He emphasised that while concerns about service quality are valid, expecting businesses to operate at a loss is unsustainable.If the goal is better service, letTMs have that discussion.</english> <english>But resorting to actions that could disrupt the industry and the economy isnTMt the way forward, he added.[quote]The telecom executive further stated that telcos are solely focused on improving services that will be beneficial to subscribers and get value for their money.But speaking with The PUNCH, the Lagos State NLC Chairperson, Funmi Sessi, rejected the warnings from the NSCDC, making it clear that Labour would not be cowed by threats.No one can threaten us  no one!</english> <english>This is about our commonwealth, our joint heritage.</english> <english>Civil Defence officers are merely working for their pay, but they have no authority to dictate to us.</english> <english>If necessary, we will shut down the electricity itself!</english> <english>Who are they to tell us otherwise?</english> <english>she declared.She further lambasted the security forces for attempting to intimidate workers, saying,Let them threaten all they want, nothing will stop us.</english> <english>We know the song we how many people will the soldiers kill?</english> <english>Even the police must remember to remain civil.</english> <english>They cannot kill us all!</english>

<english>A priest of the Catholic Diocese of Awka, Anambra State, whose name was given as Rev.</english> <english>Fr Jude Muokwe, has allegedly beaten up a 50-Year-Old Widow, Mrs Ikeorah Maureen.The priest was said to have used a whip on the widow, flogging her mercilessly and inflicting multiple injuries on her in the process.A Video of the widow, which is already trending on social media, showed the primary school teacher crying like a baby, and displaying bodily injuries inflicted on her by the priest.The widow is said to be from Ifitedunu community in Dunukofia LGA and also a teacher in Angel Primary School, Ifitedunu, a school said to be owned and managed by the Catholic mission.Though the real cause of the incident has not been ascertained, DAILY POST gathered thatthe widow and some other staff of the school were meeting in one of the classrooms in the school over salary increment, which they planned to pass to the management, when the priest came into the classroom and flogged her mercilessly, to the amazement of everyone.When DAILY POST reached out to the priest, Rev Fr Jude Muokwe, to ascertain what truly happened,the priest did not deny the allegation.</english> <english>He simply said he would not like to comment on the matter.I cannot speak to you, I canTMt speak especially to someone I do not know about this matter,the priest said in a sober tone.</english>

<pidgin>Some reverend fathers see themselves as demi-gods, especially those in the East, I was told of one over-pampered and worshiped reverend father that was asking people to knell down and he would flog them once you come to the church late, my father was telling me about this and I thought it was just a joke until I traveled to the village and we went to service together, it was 4am and my dad was already panicking and waking everyone up to bath and get ready as the service states by 6amWe all got ready before 30 since the church wasn't far from our house, but unfortunately my car battery was very low and we had to remove the battery and jump start it with another car before it moved, we got to the church by 25 and the Reverend father had locked the church entrance and people were knelling down and waiting for him to come and flog them and to allow them enter, I was parked and came down, strolled to the church entrance and I was flabbergasted with what I saw, people fathers and mothers with white hair knelling down, I was provoked, and I also saw youths there and none could say anything, I waited patiently until he came out with long koboko, I tell my dad that if this man flogs any one here I was going to punch him, my dad knew I don't bluff and he started begging me, my mum was urging me on to please punch him.</pidgin> <pidgin>He came out and started flogging people 4 lashes before you are allowed to enter, I walked straight to him and started making videos, I told him that I was going to post the video and report his conduct, he ordered the mass servants to collect my phone from me, me way they secretly look for a way to fight since, I been dey gym everyday I didn't know I was preparing for this battle all my life     .They came with force and I punched the guy straight on his nose and he fell down straight, the second one rushed me, and I picked him up and dropped him on the ground like a bag of rubbish, he stood up and ran away, to my surprise everyone was cheering me on instead of try to stop the fight, including my mom      .The next thing I heard on my back was tawai, I looked back and it was the revered father, he had flogged me with his koboko, omo, I just held him his hands, collected the koboko, and started flogging the werey like mad, I made sure I started from this head, before police came in to separate the fight, him head don get plenty gallops of injury     , the most annoying thing is that he's just a young priest, not more than 28 years old, I dealt with the idiot to my satisfaction, jump inside the car with my family and drove home, my mum was just healing me as we drove home after making statement at the police    That was it, my parent later told me after I had done back to Abuja that the our community igwe reported him to the convent and  they never went back to the church the next Sunday, the removed him and suspended him, and brought another Reverend come and see jubilation</pidgin>

<english>The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, NAFDAC, has evacuated 140 tonnes of expired and unregistered drugs from Aba to its office in Anambra.Mr Omoyeni Babatunji, the Deputy Director in charge of Investigation and Enforcement, NAFDAC Federal Taskforce, South South and South East states, disclosed this on Saturday.Babatunji, while briefing newsmen about the agencyTMs operations in Aba, said more than 178 drug samples drawn from the operation would be subjected to laboratory investigation.He said the 140 tonnes of expired drugs were evacuated from a warehouse in Umummeje, Umuocheala in Osisioma Local Government Area, which excludes products from the Ariaria International Market drug shops.Babatunji told newsmen that two warehouses located on No.</english> <english>269, Sam Mbakwe Road, formerly FaulkTMs Road, Aba, filled with expired drugs had also been uncovered.He said staff of the agency found that the suspects took away some cartons of the expired but re-labelled drugs after they uncovered the place and went to bring in security.The NAFDAC deputy director who took newsmen round the two freshly uncovered warehouses of expired products, said the evacuation of the drugs in them would start on Saturday evening.He noted that recent discoveries of expired products being re-labelled and sent to markets has renewed the urgent call for a drug warehouse Wholesale Control Centre, CWC in Aba.He said this activity is a drive toward the achievement of Wholesale Control Centres, CWCs, as NAFDAC is now on ML3 or what we call Maturity Level 3 of the World Health Organisation, WHO."All these our activities are derived from global benchmarking tools for regulatory activities and coordinated warehouse system is part of it so we can regulate and control those drugs.And NAFDAC has been engaging state governors of Abia and Anambra, where those centres are located, pushing for the establishment of the CWC warehouse system..</english> <english>Nlfpmod</english>

<english>The Nigeria Police Force has neutralised seven suspected members of the Eastern Security Network (ESN), the armed wing of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), in two separate operations in Imo State.The operations, carried out on February 8 and 9, 2025, reportedly led to the recovery of a cache of weapons, including eight AK-47 rifles, 14 pump-action guns, and assorted ammunition.According to a statement released on Sunday by Police Force spokesperson ACP Olumuyiwa Adejobi,the first operation targeted an IPOB/ESN camp in Ezioha Mbaitolu, within the Umuele Umuaka Njaba Local Government Area (LGA).Adejobi explained that security operatives, working in collaboration with other agencies, stormed the hideout, neutralising two suspected ESN kingpins and recovering seven AK-47 rifles, 13 pump-action guns, and hundreds of live rounds.He said the operation successfully dismantled the camp, dealing a major blow to the groupTMs activities in the region.He said, "As a follow-up, police operatives moved to Nkwukwo Forest in Mbaitoli LGA, at the boundary with Ubachima Forest in Awomama Oru West LGA, on February 9.</english> <english>Upon arrival, the security team encountered armed terrorists who opened fire.</english> <english>In the ensuing gun battle, three additional ESN kingpins were neutralised."The police recovered two AK-47 rifles, each loaded with 36 rounds of live ammunition, one pump-action gun, four motorcycles, a cutlass, and various criminal charms used by the suspects.Meanwhile, in another operation, on February 14, 2025, unknown armed men invaded Gobiraje Village in Suru LGA of Kebbi Stateand kidnapped one Umaru Bawa 'm' aged 60 yrs.</english> <english>Adejobi reported that police operatives from the Kebbi State Command received the report and subsequently tracked the suspects to Tundafari Forest in the Dakingari area of the state, where they engaged in a fierce gunfight."Consequently, 4 of the kidnappers were neutralised and 1 arrested with fatal injuries while the kidnapped victim was rescued unhurt.The operatives also recovered the cash sum of Three Million Naira (N3,000,000) already paid to the kidnappers as ransom," he said.Adejobi noted that the Inspector-General of Police IGP, Kayode Adeolu Egbetokun, Ph.D., NPM, has commended the brave efforts of the operatives involved and emphasised the need for continued vigilance in the fight against crime.He said the IGP has called for increased intelligence gathering, community engagement, and prompt reporting of suspicious activities by citizens.Nlfpmod</english>

<english>Can the same proactiveness be deployed by the police to fight Boko haram?</english> <english>It is sad that the army has to clean up the mess that the Nigerian police created in Borno state.It should be recalled that the Nigerian army arrested Yusuf, the original founder of Boko haram and handed him in cuffs over to the police.</english> <english>A few days later, the police killed him claiming he exchanged fire with them.</english> <english>Exactly how does someone in detention and in a cell get to fire a weapon at officers?The death of Yusuf is what triggered Boko Haram to engage on all out attacks against Nigeria's security architecture.</english> <english>They initially focused on policemen as targets.Boko haram as we know it would have fizzled out long ago if Yusuf had not been killed.</english> <english>The question is, why was he killed?</english> <english>Whose secret would Yusuf have exposed that necessitated his death in custody?</english>

<english>The Federal Government has called on the United States to adhere to international conventions when repatriating Nigerian immigrants, ensuring their dignity and allowing them time to settle personal affairs before deportation.Concerns Over Deportation of NigeriansMinister of State for Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Bianca Odumegwu-Ojukwu, made this appeal during a meeting with US Ambassador to Nigeria, Richard Mills Jr., at her office in Abuja.She expressed concerns over reports that 201 Nigerians were currently held in US immigration camps, with 85 already cleared for deportation."We urge the United States to respect international repatriation protocols and ensure that affected Nigerians have the opportunity to retrieve their assets and return with dignity," she stated.Ambassador Odumegwu-Ojukwu further emphasized the importance of fair treatment, particularly for those who have not committed any criminal offenses.Visa Policy and Nigerian Students in the USThe minister also urged the US government to reconsider any plans to suspend the Drop Box Visa System, which many Nigerians rely on for easy visa renewal.</english> <english>She requested an official statement to clarify the US position.In addition, she raised concerns about the future of Nigerian students in the US and the uncertainty surrounding USAID programs, stressing the need for continued bilateral cooperation.US Response and Trade RelationsIn response, Ambassador Mills reassured the minister that the Drop Box Visa System had not been suspended but was under review.Regarding deportations, he clarified that individuals being repatriated would be returned to Lagos, with priority given to those convicted of crimes or violating immigration laws.On trade relations, the US envoy highlighted the upcoming expiration of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) in September and encouraged Nigeria to push for its renewal.He reaffirmed the United States' commitment to strengthening diplomatic and economic ties with Nigeria.Crackdown on Illegal ImmigrationThe United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) identified 3,690 Nigerians among nearly two million non-citizens slated for deportation under President Donald TrumpTMs administrationTMs immigration policies.The Federal Government continues to engage with US authorities to ensure that deportation processes align with international standards and that Nigerian nationals are treated fairly.The Bureau Newspaper</english>

<english>President Bola Tinubu has called on the African Union Peace and Security Council (AUPSC) to prioritize the establishment of a Combined Maritime Task Force to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea.Speaking at the 38th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (AU) Heads of State and Government in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Tinubu expressed NigeriaTMs readiness to host the headquarters of the proposed task force in Lagos.Delivering NigeriaTMs position on behalf of the President, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, emphasized the urgent need for collective maritime security efforts."The time has come for the African Union Peace and Security Council to prioritise the creation of a Combined Maritime Task Force for the Gulf of Guinea.I wish to announce that Nigeria would like to host the headquarters of the task force in Lagos."Nigeria Signs Strategic Agreement with AUTinubuTMs call for a maritime task force coincided with NigeriaTMs signing of a landmark agreement with the AU to provide Strategic Sea Lift Services for peace support operations, natural disaster response, humanitarian actions, and personnel movement.NigeriaTMs Minister of Defence, Badaru Abubakar, signed the agreement, under which the Nigerian Navy will provide a vessel for these operations on a cost-recovery basis.The signing ceremony was witnessed by Attorney-General and Justice Minister Prince Lateef Fagbemi, Foreign Affairs Minister Ambassador Yusuf Tuggar, Chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Emmanuel Ikechukwu Ogalla, and Director-General of the Nigerian Intelligence Agency, Ambassador Muhammed Muhammed.Ambassador Bankole Adeoye, the AU Commissioner for Political Affairs, Peace, and Security, signed on behalf of the African Union.Regional Security and Counter-Terrorism InitiativesPresident Tinubu commended the AUPSC for adopting recommendations from a recent high-level security meeting, including the decision to upgrade NigeriaTMs National Counter-Terrorism Centre into a Regional Counter-Terrorism Centre.He also welcomed the renewal of the mandate for the Multinational Joint Task Force (MNJTF), which combats terrorism and violent extremism in the Lake Chad Region.Expressing concerns over LibyaTMs continued instability and its spillover effects on the Sahel, Tinubu urged the AU to support initiatives aimed at restoring law and order in the North African country."The Sahel cannot enjoy peace as long as Libya does not," he warned.He further highlighted the insecurity plaguing countries in democratic transition, including Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, South Sudan, and Gabon, calling for collective AU intervention.Push for African-Led Peace Operations and Economic StabilityTinubu advocated for leveraging UN Security Council Resolution 2719 to support AU-led peace operations and warned against the increasing involvement of extra-continental military forces, including private military contractors, in AfricaTMs security matters.The President also reaffirmed NigeriaTMs commitment to the African Standby Force, urging AU members to finalize the draft Memorandum of Understanding for its full operationalization.On economic matters, Tinubu backed the establishment of an African-led Credit Rating Agency (ACRA) to provide fairer and more transparent assessments of African economies, countering biases often observed in global rating agencies."An independent African-led rating agency will help provide fairer assessments of African economies and reduce the bias often observed in existing global rating agencies," Tinubu stated.He commended the African Union, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and the Specialized Technical Committee (STC) on Finance for advancing the Africa Financing Stability Mechanism (AFSM), which aims to address rising borrowing costs, debt burdens, and limited access to affordable long-term financing."The establishment of the AFSM underscores the collective commitment of member states in addressing financial vulnerabilities and fostering economic resilience across the continent," he said.Tinubu concluded by emphasizing the importance of adopting the AFSM to strengthen financial stability and enhance AfricaTMs resilience against external economic shocks.The Bureau Newspaper</english>

<english>Why must it be in Lagos?Calabar is better located for this position, but we know everything must be sited in Tinubu's Lagos</english>

<english>The Director General of the Bureau for Public Enterprises, Ayodeji Gbeleyi, on Friday, revealed that Delta Steel Company, valued at over $700m, was sold for $30m.Gbeleyi stated this while interfacing with the House of Representatives Committee on Public Assets in Abuja.A company worth $700m was sold for just $30m, he said, noting that under the Federal GovernmentTMs privatisation policy, 80 per cent of Delta Steel Company in Aladja, Delta State, was sold to Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd in 2005, while the government retained a 20 per cent stake.He explained that residential buildings and land owned by the company were used to settle workers and pensioners.After privatisation, the company reportedly used Delta Steel CompanyTMs assets as collateral for a loan from Ecobank.The BPE DG further revealed that due to non-performance, the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria acquired the assets in 2015 and sold them to Premium Steel and Mines Ltd.He accused AMCON of failing to seek clarification from BPE before selling the assets, stressing that while BPE was aware of the loan from Ecobank, it had no knowledge of three other banks listed by AMCON as creditors.The petitioners, including the Association of Concerned Residents of Camp 2, 4 and 5 of Delta Steel Company, Aladja, Warri, before the involvement of AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines in DSC assets, had been staying in the estate and plots of land which were used to settle them in line with contractual agreement.The petitioners claimed that they have been under constant intimidation and harassment by police and Army personnel since 2015, claiming to be acting on the instructions from AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines to vacate the estates.Speaking on behalf of the petitioners, Dr David Emomotimi and Richardson Osifor, said the assets AMCON acquired were assets used as collateral by Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd to obtain a loan from Ecobank which did not in any way include the residential buildings.Osifor said from the contract agreement and information at the Corporate Affairs Commission, the loan Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd obtained from Ecobank was N250m but AMCOM jacked it up to N7bn.In their submission, the representatives of AMCON, Chukwuemeka Umunakwu (AMCON legal unit), said AMCON acquired the assets of DSC used as collateral to obtain loans from four banks to prevent them from collapsing.He said AMCON acquired the assets at N22bn but sold it to Premium Steel and Mines at N32bn.Responding to the inquiry by the committee whether the Office of the Accountant General of the Federation has the receipt of payments by both BPE and AMCON in respect of sales of Delta Steel CompanyTMs assets, the representative of AGF, Kabiru Ademola (Director, Finance) acknowledged receipt of N3bn in favour of BPE in respect of sales of 80 per cent of DSC assets to Global Infrastructure Nigeria Ltd.He stated that the AGF is yet to get any response from Central Bank of Nigeria regarding claim of payment of N32bn by AMCON in respect of DSC assets to Premium Steel and Mines Ltd.According to him, though AMCON claimed the money was paid to the Federation Account (TSA), the agency was unable to provide proof of payment to the committee.In his submission, Managing Director/CEO of the Ministry of Finance Incorporated, Dr.</english> <english>Armstrong Takang, said though MOFI oversees the management of assets and investments in the country, the agency withdrawn from the issue of Delta Steel Company as a result of many controversies.He said, If our forefathers who were less exposed and less educated would build such infrastructure and maintaining it by our contemporary leaders LovePeddler are more exposed and educated than them will be a problem, I wonder what will be the future of the country.Chairman of the Committee, Ademorin Kuye (APC, Lagos), said the committee whose mandate includes oversight over the use, management and disposal of all Federal Government assets within and outside the country decided to probe the purported sales of the Delta Steel Company and the controversies surrounding its acquisition by AMCON.The committee directed AMCON and Premium Steel and Mines to desist from harassing the residents of the estate in Delta Steel Company untill the investigation is concluded.</english>

<english>Panel indicts ex-Gov Obaseki, LG chairmen, PDP leaders for alleged mismanage of N96bn Council fund.The administrative panel of inquiry set up by the Edo State Governor, Monday Okpebholo to investigate the financial accounts of the impeached 18 Local Government Chairmen in the state between September 4, 2023 and November, 2024 has allegedly indicted the immediate past Governor of the State, Godwin Obaseki.DAILY POST reports that a statement made available to newsmen on Sunday by Fred Itua, the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor also allegedly indicted some local government chairmen, leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, among others.The chairman of the panel, Solomon Imohiosen while submitting the report to Governor Monday Okpebholo, alleged that they were indicted for either mismanaging and/or diverting to private accounts, the sum of N95,080,676,687.86, being amount received from the Joint Allocation Account Committee, JAAC, by the 18 Local Government Area Chairmen for the period under review.Imohiosen listed some of the indicted persons to include the embattled chairman of Orhionmwon Local Government, Newman Ugiagbe who is also the State chairman of the Association of Local Government of Nigeria, ALGON.Others are Ahonsi Ogiegbaen Osifo, Eric Agbonmwanre, Abraham Burma and Dickson Imasogie Notiemwenmwan.He alleged that the ALGON chairman used his hotel, the Demarriots Hotels Limited in collusion with others to loot Local Government funds.He further alleged that findings and forensic investigations uncovered that the N96 billion was either mismanaged and/or diverted to private accounts.According to him, the panel observed that N95,080,676,687.86 was received from the Joint Allocation Account Committee, JAAC, by the 18 Local Government Area Chairmen for the period under investigation.</english> <english>However, the funds were not judiciously utilized as no meaningful projects were on the ground to justify the amount received.The panel established a case of fraudulent diversion of Local Government funds to political godfathers in the state.</english> <english>It was discovered that over N10,433 658,452.00 billion was fraudulently siphoned, using the pseudo name, Security, Environment and Training.The 18 Local Government Area Chairmen contributed the amount to the account, using it as a conduit pipe to drain government resources, as monies were transferred from there to various individuals and companies.The panelTMs investigation uncovered significant irregularities in the financial activities of the 18 Local Governments Councils.</english> <english>The recommendations outlined in the report aim to address these issues and promote transparency and accountability in the Local Governments finances.The report indicted former ALGON chairman, Oghomwen Newman Ugiagbe, who used his hotel, Demarriots Hotels Limited, Ahonsi Ogiegbaen Osifo, Eric Agbonmwanre, Abraham Burma and Dickson Imasogie Notiemwenmwan to loot Local Government funds, he alleged.Imohiosen, however, noted that the panel faced different challenges during the course of the assignment, which included late submission of financial records by various Local Government Councils, incomplete submission of records.Other challenges, he listed are deliberate obstruction of the investigation by Council personnel who failed to comply on time, but brought hefty sacks as an after-thought to dazzle panel members.In his remarks after receiving the committeeTMs report, Governor Okpebholo vowed that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, would prosecute those indicted for allegedly looting the Local Government treasuries, running into over N95 billion.Okpebholo, who said, he would personally petition the EFCC on the findings of the report for immediate prosecution, assured that he would go after those indicted to retrieve what they have stolen from the people of Edo State.I want to thank you for a job well done.</english> <english>I carefully listened to the submission of the report.</english> <english>The truth is that the administration of former governor Godwin Obaseki took Edo people for granted.</english> <english>They took everything belonging to Edo people and channeled it for their personal gains.We thank God for helping us to change the narrative to benefit Edo people.</english> <english>We also thank the President of Nigeria, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, because without his support, we will not be witnessing the kind of development we are experiencing in Edo today.A lot has happened.</english> <english>The Peoples Democratic Party looted the treasury of the Local Governments and stole our collective patrimony, and nobody went after them or took action.</english> <english>This time, things are different.</english> <english>We will go after them and retrieve what they have stolen from Edo people.They will be made to pay for it.</english> <english>I will personally take this document to the EFCC and ensure that justice is done for this wrong done to Edo people.Besides the impeached Local Government Chairmen who were indicted by the report, former governor Godwin Obaseki, leaders of the factional Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), among others, were also fingered.The days of financial recklessness and lack of transparency in public office were long over, as Nigerians need to start demanding accountability from elected public office holders.</english> <english>This is the only way to fight corruption and ensure development, he said.DAILY POST recalls that Governor Okpebholo had on December 18, 2024 set up the Administrative Panel of Enquiry to investigate the financial dealings of the impeached 18 Local Government Chairmen in Edo State.</english>

<pidgin>French President, Emmanuel Macron has reportedly scheduled an emergency meeting for European leaders to discuss United States President Donald Trump.Fox News, citing Politico, reports that Polish Foreign Minister Radosaw Sikorski on Saturday made an allusion to the meeting at the Munich Security Conference.According to the report, two EU officials told the Politico that the meeting would take place on Monday.ITMm very glad that President Macron has called our leaders to Paris, Sikorski was quoted as saying, noting that the event would involve talking about the implications of TrumpTMs actions in a very serious fashion.Sikorski has not shied away from discussing US politics in the past.He previously compared President Joe BidenTMs poor debate performance to the decline of ancient Rome, while at other time said Trump was right to say that NATO countries need to spend more on their own defense.The report further noted that Macron has been cordial to Trump since the latterTMs reelection in November last year.The French leader had, in a post on X, expressed a willingness to work with Trump.Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump, MacronTMs post read.</pidgin> <english>Ready to work together as we did for four years.</english> <english>With your convictions and mine.</english> <english>With respect and ambition.</english> <english>For more peace and prosperity.Macron said it was an honor to host Trump in December, when he visited Paris to witness the reopening of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</english>

<english>Binance Bribery Opposition leaders defend RibaduTMs integrity as Gambaryan insists on accusations.The opposition leaders said Mr Ribadu is a man of integrity and incapable of the allegations levelled against him.Two outspoken members of opposition groups in Nigeria have expressed support for National Security Adviser Nuhu Ribadu, following a series of allegations levelled against him by BinanceTMs head of financial crime, Tigran Gambaryan.The opposition leaders said Mr Ribadu is a man of integrity and incapable of the allegations levelled against him.On Friday, Mr Gambaryan accused the NSA of seeking to personally benefit from NigeriaTMs dispute with Binance.Ribadu emphasised that he wanted billions in payouts to fund his future political ambition, Mr Gambaryan said.The crypto firmTMs official also claimed that Mr Ribadu hired a US law firm to negotiate his release from detention while in Nigerian custody but the move failed due to their incompetence and greed.Mr Gambaryan, who was detained and tried in Nigeria for several months, made these allegations on Friday in a series of post on X.Mr Ribadu has not reacted to the allegations.</english> <pidgin>However, the Nigerian government, in its Friday response, accused Mr Gambaryan of making false claims.Information Minister Mohammed Idris said the allegations are not only unsubstantiated but also lack credibility, given his apparent motive to discredit and intimidate those who ensured he faced justice.In response, the American insisted, on Saturday, that what he said was factual.What I shared was factual, based on my personal experiences and conversations with those who have direct knowledge of the events I discussed.He added that he shared the information with both Nigerian and US law enforcement.Opposition reactA former Nigerian senator, Ben Murray-Bruce, said he believes the allegations against Mr Ribadu are false and baseless.I have known Mallam Nuhu Ribadu my entire life, and I can say with absolute certainty that he is incapable of the allegations being levelled against him, Mr Murray-Bruce, a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said.</pidgin> <english>He also challenged the Binance official to undergo a lie detector test in a neutral country if believes the claims he has made.It is exhausting to witness individuals repeatedly dragging NigeriaTMs name through the mud with baseless accusations and fabricated evidence, Mr Murray-Bruce said.He said individuals like Mr Gambaryan must be decisively dealt with, ensuring that such reckless fabrications are not only exposed but also serve as a warning to other deceitful actors who seek to undermine Nigeria.In his reaction, a former PDP member and counsel to various opposition groups, Deji Adeyanju, said he believes the allegations against Mr Ribadu are politically sponsored lies.</english> <english>He said some politicians feel threatened that Mr Ribadu has an ambition to be NigeriaTMs president.</english> <pidgin>The NSA has not publicly announced such ambition.You can say anything against Nuhu Ribadu but not the issue of stealing public funds or demanding bribes from any human being.</pidgin> <english>Ribadu will never steal $1, Mr Adeyanju said.No More CommentOn Saturday, Mr Gambaryan said he is not going to provide more commentary on his Nigerian experience.I donTMt want to see my kids cry because ITMm not around.</english> <english>I donTMt want to see videos of my 75-year-old mother on television in tears.</english> <english>I donTMt want to see my wife crying on TV.</english> <english>I want to put this nightmare behind me and move on, he said.The Binance official was released in October 2024 following the intervention of the US government.</english> <english>The Nigerian government also dropped charges against him.</english> <english>The government accused him and Binance of money laundering and encouraging criminality in Nigeria, allegations they denied.</english>

<english>Northern leaders have been divided over the possible re-election of President Bola Tinubu in 2027.</english> <english>Findings by Sunday PUNCH revealed that the once monolithic North is now split, with core northerners determinedto oust Tinubu in 2027, while northern minorities support his re-election.Our correspondents noted that although core northerners complain about the PresidentTMs unfavourable disposition towards the region, minority groups argue that they have fared well under his administration.The Middle Belt, southern Kadunaresidents, Hausa Christians of Northern Nigeria, and many natives of Plateau State have distanced themselves from the plot to unseat Tinubu.However, core northerners, represented by various political, socio-cultural, and indigenous groups, insist that Tinubu does not deserve a second term.The division among northern stakeholders is evident in social media exchanges between former Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, and a human rights activist, Senator Shehu Sani, who frequently express differing views on TinubuTMs approach to northern issues, particularly security.The Arewa Consultative Forum, a key political and cultural association in Northern Nigeria, alongside several prominent northern figures, said the region could not be coerced into re-electing Tinubu.Speaking with Sunday PUNCH , the Secretary General of the group, Murtala Aliyu, stated that the forum remained nonpartisan and would not support or oppose any candidate.The ACF was responding to a recent statement by the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress, Abdullahi Ganduje, who urged northern politicians with presidential ambitions to abandon their aspirations because Tinubu would serve for two terms.What we normally do at ACF is to highlight critical issues that the people should consider when choosing a candidate, irrespective of their political party.</english> <english>We do not involve ourselves in promoting or antagonising any candidate, Aliyu said.The League of Northern Democrats, a northern group comprising members of the APC, the Peoples Democratic Party, and the New Nigeria Peoples Party, vowed to support an alternative candidate in 2027.</english> <english>The spokesperson for the group, Ladan Salihu, said,We donTMt have a personal agenda against Tinubu, but we believe his government has not delivered.</english> <english>The performance indicators do not add up to justify northern support.The government has not met expectations, and we in the North are not convinced he deserves another opportunity.</english> <english>Even those who voted for him are now filled with regret.His administration has brought hardship, poverty and agony to the people.</english> <english>No northerner with a conscience can claim to be impressed with TinubuTMs performance.</english> <english>He may have the best intentions, but the system he is working with is flawed and unsustainable.</english> <english>It cannot deliver on the promises he made to the North.Salihu also hinted at the possibility of a new political movement to field a northern candidate against Tinubu in 2027.</english> <english>Yes, there is a possibility, because we are not convinced that this government can lift Nigeria out of its current predicament, he said.Similarly, the National Coalition of Northern Groups warned that the North would not vote for Tinubu if economic conditions did not improve.</english> <english>In an interview with Sunday PUNCH , the coalition president, Jamilu Charanchi, stated that the North, which holds the majority of votes, would not re-elect Tinubu if economic hardship persisted.It is the people who will decide who leads the countrythere is no doubt about that.</english> <english>The North has a majority.</english> <english>It is up to President Tinubu to make the right decisions so that people will re-elect him.If he continues on this path, I can tell you clearly that people will not vote for him, he said.</english> <english>Urging Nigerians to vote wisely, Charanchi advised the electorate to choose leaders based on competence, capacity, integrity and adherence to the rule of law.</english> <english>He said,Nigerians should not allow themselves to be manipulated by politicians.</english> <english>They should vote based on merit and mobilise others to elect leaders who will lift the country out of its current crisis.Charanchi described GandujeTMs comment as troubling and disheartening, stating that it indicated the APC chairman was out of touch with reality.Is he satisfied with NigeriaTMs failing economy?</english> <english>Does he believe these failures are acceptable or justified?</english> <english>he asked.A former Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Babachir Lawal, had previously hinted at northern efforts to remove Tinubu in 2027.</english> <english>Lawal recently declared his intention to work with El-Rufai to prevent TinubuTMs re- election.In an interview, Lawal blamed TinubuTMs economic policies for worsening poverty and hardship in Northern Nigeria.The North is seriously mobilising with a consensus that Bola Tinubu must step down in the 2027 election.</english> <english>There is no doubt about this consensus.I may not have always agreed with El-Rufai, but on this issue, I will join him to stop Tinubu from winning the 2027 election.</english> <english>If Tinubu wins, northern Nigeria will turn into one large refugee camp, he said.El-Rufai, on Monday, shared on his X handle an opinion by a chieftain of the party, Uche Diala, who warned that if Tinubu was not careful, he might face the same fate as former President Goodluck Jonathan ahead of the 2027 election.The article stated, I have read and heard the arrogant posturing and braggadocio by some people who I refer to as political rabble-rousers, but I get more worried each day as it keeps looking more and more like a movie we had seen before.May I remind some persons that, more than the performance or lack thereof of the President Goodluck Jonathan administration, it was his attitude, and that of people around him, towards the North that ultimately brought him down and by extension the PDP that had boasted that it would rule Nigeria for 60 years.El-Rufai himself had on his X handle criticised the APC, lamenting the lack of internal democracy and active party structures within the party.He wrote I no longer recognise the APC.</english> <english>No party organ has met in two years no caucus, no NEC, nothing.</english> <english>You donTMt even know if it is a one-man show; itTMs a zero-man show.However, the Northern minorities distanced themselves from the plot to oust Tinubu.One of the notable northern minority groups, the Middle Belt Forum, stated that the region had decided to support a southern presidency in 2027.The MBF argued that the region had received a better deal under the current administration than under former President Muhammadu Buhari, despite prevailing economic hardships.According to the MBFTMs spokesman, Luka Binniyat, the Middle Belt has secured more political appointments at thenational level and more infrastructural projects than under the previous government.Sunday PUNCH noted that Middle Belt indigenes in TinubuTMs administration include the Secretary to the Government of the Federation, George Akume (Benue State), and the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management, and Social Development, Prof.</english> <english>Nentawe Goshwe Yilwatda (Plateau State).We are having a better deal under Bola Tinubu than under Buhari, even though we are all experiencing economic hardship like everyone else.The Middle Belt Forum, for sure, still stands for a southern presidency in 2027.</english> <english>So, it is up to President Tinubu to up his game to attract the Middle Belt when an alternative candidate emerges in 2027, Binniyat said.Similarly, indigenous Hausa Christians of Northern Nigeria dissociated themselves from the plot to remove Tinubu in 2027, stating that they would not be pressured into making a decision that could negatively impact the social well- being of their people.According to the Christian group, TinubuTMs administration had demonstrated a commitment to addressing the insecurity that has plagued many northern states.All we want at the moment is inclusivity, as we have many qualified individuals and seasoned politicians capable of holding political office.Instead of calling for the PresidentTMs removal in 2027, we are urging him to consider some of our people for appointments, as we refuse to inherit anyoneTMs enemies, said the National Chairman of the group, Daniel Musa.Some indigenes of Plateau State also declared support for TinubuTMs second term.</english> <english>Speaking with Sunday PUNCH under the auspices of the Plateau Initiative for the Development and Advancement of the Natives in Jos, the indigenes acknowledged the PresidentTMs contributions to the development of their region.</english> <english>The associationTMsSecretary General, Dickson Auta, said,He (Tinubu) has indeed shown that he is a detribalised leader because he has been striving to spread developmental projects across every part of the country.Our people are only concerned about good governance, and if Mr President continues on this developmental path, I am sure our people will have no choice but to support his ambition in 2027 should he decide to run for a second term.In fact, we are already supporting him.</english> <english>Also, the Southern Kaduna PeopleTMs Union commended Tinubu for appointing individuals from Southern Kaduna to key positions.A spokesperson for SOKAPU, Josiah Abraks, cited the appointment of Gen.</english> <english>Christopher Musa as Chief of Defence Staff and the establishment of the Federal University of Applied Science, Kachia, as examples of the PresidentTMs inclusivity, which has benefited the people of Southern Kaduna.The southern part of Kaduna is willing to partner with whoever is ready to work with us to ensure our growth and development, he added.</english>
<english>Middle Belt is in the bag already, the pity votes and religious sentiments Obi got from there during the last election is dead and buried.As for the Arewa Consultative Forum, they are Atiku's boys, they supported him during the last election and they lost.</english> <english>Their opinion is therefore inconsequential.</english> <english>Is it not the same NE and NW that people are decamping to APC everyday.</english> <english>As a matter of fact, present APC under Tinubu has become even bigger and stronger than under Buhari.</english> <pidgin>They say Buhari was the only one pulling APC together and after he leaves office, APC would split but today, the reverse is the case.</pidgin> <english>In 2027, Tinubu will collect 25% in 10 states out of the 13 states in the core North.</english> <pidgin>It is done and dusted.After God, na Tinubu a God bless Nigeria</pidgin>

<pidgin>The north just want to be in power all the time.You may think they are interested in national progress, but they are not .They just want to remain in power as if they are the only tribe entitled to power in Nigeria.I am not a fan of Tinubu, but I wonder why these same people were silence when buhari was the president.The north will dare not stop the south from 2 terms.</pidgin> <pidgin>I don't care if it is Tinubu or anyone, the south must complete 8 yrs in aso rock.</pidgin>

<english>The Lagos State Government has issued a 24-hour quit notice to illegal traders and occupants under the Idumota, Ebute Ero Police Police overhead, and environs in Lagos Island to vacate due to violations of environmental laws and degradation.Meanwhile,the state government also ordered the immediate unsealing of the Oke Arin/Gorodom Market, following a mutual agreement reached.The market was shut down over environmental degradation and encroachment on drainage alignments.Commissioner for the Environment and Water Resources,Tokunbo Wahab, gave the directives on Sunday during an on-the-spot assessment of the compliance level in the affected markets.Wahab, therefore, warned that failure of the affected occupants to vacate the area within the stipulated period of grace would attract severe consequences.The Special Adviser on Environment, Engr.</english> <english>Olakunle Rotimi-Akodu, Permanent Secretary, Office of Environmental Services, Dr.</english> <english>Gaji Omobolaji; Permanent Secretary, Office Drainage Services, Engr.</english> <english>Mahamood Adegbite; Managing Director Lagos State Waste Management Authority, LAWMA, Dr.</english> <english>Muyiwa Gbadegesin, as well as some ministry management staff, were also part of the inspection team.According to Wahab, We have come to inspect the level of compliance with respect to the directive given to keep off our drainage alignments and remove every impediment around the alignment.We came here about three weeks ago; we could see the high level of encroachment where people were selling on the drainage itself.</english> <english>It was a very unpalatable sight to behold.This led to serving the traders notices to vacate, and we had to re-establish that drainage and the right of way.</english> <english>All the connecting tertiary drainages were also opened up.We also engaged with the traders upon which they gave their written undertaking and agreed to maintain what we have opened up, which led to the immediate unsealing of the market.From there, we inspected the Idumota and environs.We could see the level of environmental degradation and itTMs not something we want to keep unaddressed.We had to serve them quit notice to remove them and after then we shall do the needful.He stressed the need for residents, including traders at all markets, to prioritize environmental cleanliness to prevent the spread of diseases.It is necessary for everyone to take care of the environment; the traders caused the closure of the market; the government will not let down its guards.</english> <pidgin>Going forward, we are determined to go around nooks and crannies of Lagos State to re-establish our drainage alignments in order to avoid flooding because whenever there is a flood in the state, you people will accuse the government of being irresponsible, he said.Wahab explained the illegal process in which shop owners/ traders had converted the setback of the drainage channels in the markets to stalls had impeded the free flow of stormwater and could lead to serious disease breakouts of Cholera, Diarrhea, typhoid fever, amongst others, saying if each and everyone make good sanitation practices a daily affair in their shops and environs, it would save the citizenry from continuous visit to the hospitals.With these illegal stalls and shops, if proper care is not taken, we can have a major disease outbreak, and these outbreaks can have negative impacts on our health care system, such that we would start undertaking various tests which we can avoid by doing the needful in every corner of our stalls he said.He recalled that the State Government had banned styrofoam over a year ago due to its adverse effects on human health and drainage channels.</pidgin> <pidgin>He observed that some traders are still using and littering the market environment with the banned item and urged them to stop.I would like to appeal to our traders who still engage in selling styrofoams packs that we donTMt want to see styrofoams in our markets; it is obvious that some of you are still storing these styrofoams in your stores; It is high time you collaborate with the government as traders to help protect the environment and all the drainage alignments he stressed.Wahab emphasized that Global warming and climate change is real as such everyone must become responsible in order to push back the climate challenges and effects as much as possible.Let us make our choices now; markets are not meant to be sleeping places.</pidgin> <english>If You people have been collecting money from those sleeping in the markets in the past, such people should stop giving you money.</english> <english>The government is not asking for your money; just fix the little necessary things in your corners; stop connecting your sewage system to the drainage alignment; stop discharging your waste into the drainage alignment.</english> <pidgin>Stop building on the drainage alignment so that the drainages can remain clean always; the rains are coming, and we must be prepared, he added.During the tour,the Commissioner also ordered the immediate sealing of Kabaran Global NigeriaApogbon Truck Park on Adeniji Adele Road after the expiration of several abatement notices served, stressing that the contractor that would repair the major road is expected to move to the site and that the space had been allocated for the contractorTMs use.The Commissioner sounded a note of warning again to developers and residents who are fond of dumping building materials on the roads and drainage channels, thereby causing serious blockage to the natural flow of water, to desist from such acts while ordering the immediate sealing of a shopping complex under construction along Adeniji Adele Road.In an appreciation response, Alhaja Basirat Owolewa, who spoke on behalf of the Iyaloja of Gorodom Market, expressed appreciation to the government for opening up all blocked drainage channels in the market.She promised that traders in the market and around the re-established channel would be compelled to promote good sanitation practices and make it a priority from now on.</pidgin>

<english>This is not the first time the Bakura Doro-led faction of Boko Haram and ISWAP engaged in such violent fighting on the islands of Lake Chad Basin.by Yakubu MohammedTwo weeks after a failed reconciliation move between JamaTMtu Ahlis Sunna LiddaTMawati wal-Jihad (JAS), popularly known as Boko Haram, and its breakaway faction, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), both groups have resumed fighting in Abadam Local Government Area of Borno State.This is not the first time the Bakura Doro-led faction of Boko Haram and ISWAP engaged in such violent fighting on the islands of Lake Chad Basin.The recent clash, according to Zagazola Makama, a counterinsurgency expert in the North-east, occurred on 14 February around ISWAP camps in Toumbun Gini and Toumbun Ali.Mr Makama, in an X post, said ISWAP suffered heavy casualties in the battle that was fought on water.</english> <english>He said the fighting may continue and spread to Kukawa LGA, where Boko Haram fighters continue their campaign against ISWAP.Both groups have been fighting each other since ISWAP split from Boko Haram in 2016 and pledged allegiance to the Islamic State.Abubakar Shekau, a former idiosyncratic leader of JAS, had, in 2015, pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), making him the leader of ISWAP.However, ideological differences forced some top members of the group, including Habib Yusuf, the son of Boko Haram founder Mohammed Yusuf, to fall out with Mr Shekau.The breakaway faction led by Mr Yusuf, otherwise known as Abu Musab al-Barnawi, went ahead to bear the name ISWAP with its operational bases in the islands and shores of the Lake Chad basin, restricting their brothers-in-arms to places like Sambisa and Mandara Mountain in Gwoza.The genesis of the infightingWhen the groups first split in 2016, the Islamic State tried all it could to reconcile them, but the negotiation failed majorly as a result of Mr ShekauTMs ideological stance, especially on who should be regarded as a kufar [apostate] and why they must be executed.That same year of the schism, the Islamic State officially recognised Mr Yusuf as the leader of ISWAP.</english> <english>This situation forced Mr Shekau and some of his loyalists to revert to his JAS designation.Subsequently, a clash between ISWAP and Boko Haram led to the death of Mr Shekau, who experts believe killed himself to escape ridicule after his Sambisa hideout was raided on 19 May 2021.</english> <english>This ended Mr ShekauTMs 11 years of terror campaign.As the shadowy Bakura Doro succeeded Mr Shekau, supremacy fights between both groups continued, diminishing their strengths.</english> <english>This is besides strategic military offensives against the groups, although it is believed that these rivalry fights have killed more insurgents than military offensives.The failed reconciliationTwo weeks earlier, Mr Doro wrote a letter to the ISWAP leadership, seeking reconciliation between both groups, said Malik Samuel, a researcher with a deep understanding of jihadi groups in northeastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad Basin region.PREMIUM TIMES could not get a copy of the letter written by Mr Doro.</english> <english>But Mr Samuel said insiders told him the letter was about reconciliation.He explained that ISWAP set up a committee to look into the request before the current clash.A Borno-based journalist who has been reporting on violent extremism in the North-east corroborated Mr Samuel, saying the reconciliation process failed.The ongoing clash may not be unconnected with the failed peace deal, the journalist, who asked not to be named for his safety, said.Although the ISWAP has always been open for reconciliation with Boko Haram since the death of Mr Shekau, the move has always failed due to differences in beliefs, such as the treatment of civilians who do not believe in jihad.As the rivalry continues, both groups now resort to guerilla tactical attacks, deploying IEDs of various types to hit their targets.</english> <english>According to experts, this shift in operational pattern shows a significant combat weakness within the groups.But that does not mean the state actors have won the war.</english> <english>Our correspondent understands that groups, especially ISWAP, intensify their endearing strategies in the local communities they control.</english> <english>Noting that more than 35 million people need support because of the instability in Lake Chad that has claimed thousands of lives, the European Union recently allocated 201 million in humanitarian aid for Sahel and Lake Chad countries.The renewed clash between the two groups, according to Mr Samuel, is a win for the Nigerian authority and other regional governments around the Lake Chad region.Had the reconciliation worked out between them, it would have been somewhat devastating to the Nigerian military and other regional forces, Mr Samuel opined, noting that rivalry clashes between the groups decimate more than the ongoing military operations in the North-eastWhen asked what could have prompted Boko Haram to write a reconciliation letter to ISWAP, the researcher explained that it may be due to the international recognition that ISWAP enjoys.It is not because of economic or funding issues, he explained.</english> <english>Boko Haram since before the death of Shekau has its funding model.</english> <english>They thrive on taxation of local fishers, herders and farmers.According to him, Boko Haram might be envious of last yearTMs scenario when Islamic State sent foreign instructors to train ISWAP fighters, including minors, in December.</english>
<english>A great scripture that fits this scenario is 2 Chronicles 22-24, where IsraelTMs enemies turned against each other and destroyed 2 Chronicles 22-24 (NIV)"As they began to sing and praise, the Lord set ambushes against the men of Ammon and Moab and Mount Seir who were invading Judah, and they were defeated.</english> <english>The Ammonites and Moabites rose up against the men from Mount Seir to destroy and annihilate them.</english> <english>After they finished slaughtering the men from Seir, they helped to destroy one another.</english> <english>When the men of Judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army, they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground; no one had escaped."</english>
<english>They should reconcile their differences and face the real enemies.</english>

<english>Labour Party still available for Ndigbo to realise presidency - AbureLP zoned presidential ticket in 2023 to SouthEast to wipe their tearsThe national chairman of the Labour Party, Barrister Julius Abure has said that the party is still ready and available to support Ndigbo to realise their ambition of ruling the country in future.The national chairman who said that the Labour Party has no regret zoning the presidency to the Southeast however tasked the leaders of the zone on the need to pursue realignment with other sections of the country and to also priorities unity and togetherness to be able to win presidential election in 2027.Abure who spoke yesterday in Abuja at the Labour Party rally organized by the South East party members in Abuja ahead of the Area Council election slated to hold early next year also assured aspirants who came in their numbers that the party will not impose candidates on them.According to Abure,"Before 2023 general election, I used to believe erroneously that Igbos were not united but by the time Peter Obi joined the party and I had the privilege of campaigning for him across the wards and across Nigeria, I discovered that the Igbos are the most united, most formidable, most industrious, most hardworking and most fearless, and that is why today, I have no regrets that in spite of all odds, we zoned the presidential ticket of our party to South East."We decided that we are going to clean the tears of the Igbos.</english> <english>And we powerfully and courageously did that in 2023 general election.</english> <english>But I think that the Igbos must also go back to the drawing board."The Igbos need more realignment with the other sections of the country.</english> <english>Over the years, students of history will agree that the Yorubas at some point were like the Igbos who were doing it all alone and they were unable to capture power.</english> <pidgin>Before during and after independence, the Yorubas couldn't make it to the presidency but when they realigned, it was easy for them to make it to the presidency.</pidgin> <english>It is a lesson for the Igbos to learn."I also think that the Igbos should be strong, firm and united with a leadership.</english> <english>I still believes that the Igbos still need to be more united and speak with one voice.</english> <english>I know that every body might not need to be together but to a very large extent, we need to be together, unity of purpose to be able to realise the dreams of the Igbos.</english> <english>I want to assure you that Labour Party is till ready and available to be able to support Ndigbo to realise the ambition of ruling the country in future."Barrister Abure also assured the aspirants that Labour Party is better than any other party in Nigeria.</english> <english>He said that the coming election in FCT will be between Labour Party and others.</english> <english>He assured them that the primaries will be credible, free and fair and that the Labour Party will not have anointed candidates."The reason why Nigeria and other political parties are in trouble is because leaders always want to subvert the wishes and aspirations of the people.</english> <english>I as the National Chairman of the Labour Party will stand to discourage that in our party.</english> <english>So in this coming election, only members of the party will be the ones that will determine who becomes the candidates of the party."Obiora IfohNational Publicity SecretaryLabour Party16-02-2025</english>

<english>TrendyBeatzanalyzes Asake's exit of YBNL!When whispers about Asake's departure from YBNL began circulating in December, it felt inevitable.</english> <english>The label that turned the young upcoming artiste from the streets of Lagos into a global Afrobeats phenomenon in just two years might be losing its prized asset.</english> <english>Born Ololade Ahmed,Asakehad spent a decade as an underground hustlerdabbling in dance, churning out music, and barely moving the needle.</english> <english>His fortunes changed in 2022, thanks to an introduction facilitated by his friend, Yhemo Lee, to the godfather of Nigerian street-pop, Olamide.OlamidedidnTMt just sign Asake; he threw the entire weight of YBNL behind him.</english> <english>From co-signs on tracks like Omo Ope to roping in Burna Boy for Sungba (Remix), Olamide went all in.</english> <english>The visionary business partnership between YBNL and Empire ensured Asake's music reached farther shores, making him a staple in UK and US Afrobeats circuits.</english> <english>Add TG OmoriTMs cinematic visualseight in totaland you have the makings of an unstoppable cultural force.</english> <english>AsakeTMs journey seemed like a perfectly executed blueprint for success.But success has a way of complicating relationships.</english> <english>The signs were clear when Lungu Boy, his third project, dropped in 2024.</english> <english>OlamideTMs fingerprints were noticeably absentno guest verses, no songwriting credits.</english> <english>The project felt disconnected, starkly contrasting the laser-focused cohesion of Mr.</english> <english>Money With The Vibe and Work of Art.</english> <english>And when reports emerged that Olamide had offered an improved deal, only for Asake to decline and choose independence, the rupture felt complete.Is It Time to Fly Solo?From a legal standpoint, Asake has every right to leave YBNL if his contract has expired.</english> <english>It's a business arrangement with a beginning and an end.</english> <english>But morality?</english> <english>ThatTMs where things get murkier.</english> <english>YBNL gambled on Asake, poured resources into his career, and turned him into a global brand.</english> <english>For Asake to exit now, just as the label is poised to recoup its investments and enjoy the fruits of their labor, feels rather ungrateful.The Double Standards of SuccessItTMs hard to ignore the hypocrisy that often surrounds conversations like this.</english> <english>If AsakeTMs career had faltered, no one would bat an eye at his decision to leave YBNL.</english> <english>The narrative would likely shift to how YBNL didnTMt do enough to support him.</english> <english>Success, however, changes the stakes.</english> <english>Now, his departure is framed as betrayal, a refusal to honour the loyalty that brought him to the top.</english> <english>This isnTMt unique to Asake.</english> <english>WizkidTMs departure from EME, Burna Boy leaving Aristokrat Records, and even Davido setting up his own DMW after a brief stint with HKNthese stories all follow a similar arc.</english> <english>For Asake, the perception is different.</english> <english>HeTMs barely two years into his reign, and the decision to leave feels premature to some, calculated to others.A Gamble on IndependenceGoing independent is not for the faint-hearted.</english> <english>It requires a robust team, deep pockets, and a strategy that extends beyond the next hit single.</english> <english>Yes, Asake now has the visibility and financial muscle to chart his own course, but he also risks losing the structure and guidance that YBNL provided.Will he thrive as an independent artiste, or will he stumble under the weight of expectations?</english> <english>Only time will tell.</english> <english>WhatTMs clear is that heTMll have to contend with a more cutthroat music business, where the stakes are higher, and the safety nets are fewer.What remains is the Will this be remembered as a savvy career move or a cautionary tale?</english> <english>Asake has the talent and momentum to make it work.</english> <english>But as history has shown, not all artistes who leave their labels at the height of their fame manage to sustain that success.For now, all eyes are on Asake.</english> <english>The road ahead will determine whether his decision to leave YBNL was a gamble worth taking or a misstep in an otherwise spectacular career.</english> <english>And for YBNL, itTMs back to the drawing boardbecause in the end, the music business waits for no one.TrendyBeatzLife goes on.</english>
<english>Can only pray and wish a brother well!Dear Lord, Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us.</english> <english>And look down upon us with forgiveness for the the sins we will have in the future.</english> <english>I know you understand that niggas ain't perfect, but we try lord.</english> <english>We try to keep our heads up in bad times.</english> <english>This is a bad time, show us the way.</english> <english>And if you can't show us the way, then forgive us for being lost.Amen</english>
<english>Must Ashake die under YBNL?He signed a 2-year contract with YBNL.</english> <english>His contract is over and he has to move on with his own brand - Giran.</english> <english>Nothing wrong at all.</english> <english>He delivered well under YBNL.Even Olamide himself had to move on and started his YBNL brand.</english> <english>It's just life.No hatred nor betrayal anywhere unless y'all bloggers just want to start one.</english> <english>They are still cool.</english>

<english>The Anambra State Police Command has arrested Christian Ndubuisi in connection with the fatal stabbing of his elder brother during an altercation.The incident, described by the state Commissioner of Police, Ikioye Orutugu, as tragic and unfortunate, has sparked renewed calls for peaceful conflict resolution within communities.In a statement released on Sunday, police spokesman, SP Tochukwu Ikenga, confirmed that Ndubuisi was apprehended on Saturday by police operatives attached to the 3-3 Divisional Headquarters, following a report of the incident.Ikenga outlined the details of the crime, stating, On February 15, 2025, operatives acted swiftly on a report and arrested Christian Ndubuisi, who allegedly killed his elder brother over a minor disagreement.He explained that during the fight, the suspect broke a bottle and used it to stab his brother.When rushed to the hospital, the victim was confirmed dead by a doctor on duty.The Commissioner of Police expressed his condolences, describing the situation as a tragic reminder of the need for conflict resolution and anger management.It is very tragic to hear that a minor disagreement escalated into a violent confrontation, resulting in the loss of life, CP Orutugu remarked.He assured all that the case would be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department in Awka for further investigation, with a commitment to ensuring justice is served.</english>

<english>Do we also have where we can report corrupt police officers.?The IGP should have a special desk at every police division for that</english>

<english>Irate youths have reportedly burnt down a Police Division in Ifon, Ose Local Government Area of Ondo State.This is as a result of the death of a young man, who was allegedly tortured to death in police custody.Although the tragic incident occurred on Saturday evening, full details were still sketchy as of Sunday when this report was filed.Daily Trust learnt from sources in Ifon, a community sharing border town with Edo State, that the death of the boy triggered protest among residents and friends of the deceased.One of the sources who spoke in confidence told our reporter on Sunday that the incident stemmed from a crisis that occurred on ValentineTMs Day.He said the protesters mobilised to the police station after learning about the victimTMs death.He explained that the police were overpowered by the protestors who stormed the station, heavily charged.When contacted, Funmilayo Odunlami-Omisanya, Police Public Relations Officer in the state, confirmed the incident, saying more policemen have been drafted to the town.She added that the Commissioner of Police, Wilfred Afolabi, was already on his way to Ifon to restore peace and prevent any further violence in the area.</english>

<english>PRESIDENT TINUBU CONGRATULATES NASIR EL-RUFAI ON 65TH BIRTHDAYPresident Bola Tinubu congratulates Mallam Nasir Ahmad El-Rufai on his 65th birthday.Mallam El-Rufai is an administrator, scholar, and politician.</english> <english>He is a founding member of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and highly regarded for his resourcefulness and brilliance.He served as governor of Kaduna State for eight years, and prior to elective office, he had served as Director-General of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, and Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) from 2003 to 2007.President Tinubu celebrates Mallam El-Rufai on this occasion and commends his endeavours for democracy; his meritorious service to the nation, and mentorship of the younger generation.The President acknowledges Mallam El-Rufai's role in the dialogues leading up to the formation of the APC and his contributions to the success of the party in the three consecutive elections of 2015, 2019, and 2023.President Tinubu wishes El-Rufai good health and strength for continuous service to the nation.</english>
<english>Tinubu still holds El-Rufai in high esteem because he knows the immense contributions El-Rufai made towards his emergence as the APC presidential candidate and subsequently the president of Nigeria.El-Rufai is too strategic to ignore, especially in the context of northern Nigeria, and Tinubu understands this fact.Forget the rantings of Reno Omokri and his fellow hordes of urchinstons, BATerians, Agbadorians and paid agents who do nothing but engage in frivolous rantings on social media, looking for likes.</english> <pidgin>Tinubu no send themEl Rufai na Tinubu baba, Losing him to the opposition will be catastrophic come 2027</pidgin>

<english>One thief hailing another</english>
<english>you means the same Kaduna that PDP won?Yes, same one.</english> <pidgin>Going by your logic, it's safe to say that Sanwo-olu and even Tinubu are irrelevant and worked against themselves by supporting Obi, since they lost Lagos in a relatively free and fair election.</pidgin> <english>They only managed to win the gubernatorial through voter suppression and by invoking tribal sentiments.</english> <english>Buhari, Ribadu, Ganduje et al lost their states to Atiku, but out of all these people, it's only Elrufai (his most vocal Northern champion) whom you guys accuse of working against Tinubu, just to provide justification for your betrayal.When are you guys going to admit that Tinubu was grossly unpopular in 2023 and now, even more so (he's been tested now and found lacking).</english> <english>He won with the least margin ever in Nigeria's political history.</english> <english>Despite all these, the numbers still show that the core North delivered Tinubu through the margins he got, at the time when even most Yorubas were too timid to openly support his campaign for fear of obidients (5.5m out of his 8.3m total was from the North.Tinubu does not even have the entire Southern base in his grip and could only salvage 4 out of 6 states in the Southwest, 1 state out of 6 in the Southsouth (Rivers state under questionable circumstances) and zero state in the Southeast.</english> <english>It wasnTMt the Northern minorities that made Tinubu president (they mostly voted Obi in protest of muslim-muslim ticket).</english> <english>It was the Northern majority (despite splitting their votes 3 ways between Tinubu, a very formidable Northern Atiku and to a lesser extent, Kwankwaso who still got over a million votes).</english> <pidgin>Numbers don't lie.Tinubu would have been better off consolidating on his Northern base, not thinking he could replace the Northern majority with the minorities.</pidgin> <english>To totally get the votes of Northern minorities, Tinubu will have to change his muslim-muslim ticket (suicide) or get CAN and all the pastors to endorse his muslim-muslim ticket (a set trap), all while improving on the economy.</english>
<english>Just give it to Tinubu, he is a real technocrat.JAGABAN, THE LORD OF POLITICS IN NIGERIA.</english>

<english>PRESS CONFERENCE BY HE, SENATOR ADEMOLA ADELEKE, EXECUTIVE GOVERNOR OF OSUN STATE.Gentlemen of the pressI called this press conference to alert the national and global audience about a deliberate plot to create chaos and anarchy in Osun state.</english> <english>I invite you all to expose a fascist anti-democratic agenda designed to enforce a non-existing court judgment on our local governments.</english> <english>This evil plot is being spearheaded by the Minister of Marine and Blue Economy,  Mr Gboyega Oyetola in active collaboration with the Osun state Commissioner of Police, the Osun state Director of DSS and the State Commandant of the Civil Defense Corps.Before I continue this address, let me affirm that I know Mr.</english> <english>President to be a true democrat, a lover of rule of law, and a believer in the sanctity of the judicial process.</english> <english>I know, as a matter of fact, that Mr.</english> <english>President will never authorise a dictatorial violation of the constitution irrespective of who is involved.</english> <english>It is crucial to add that Mr.</english> <english>President will never support any action that is capable of generating bloodbath and bloodshed.I, however, regret to inform Mr.</english> <english>President and the public that Mr Gboyega Oyetola has concluded an arrangement to cause mayhem in Osun state starting from Monday.He is issuing illegal directives to security operatives to enforce illegality simply because he is the nephew of Mr.</english> <english>President.</english> <english>I chose to alert the nation before my people are killed or maimed by a minister  dropping the name of Mr.</english> <english>President in connivance with the Osun state security operatives obeying unlawful orders.The bone of contention is the brazen effrontery to return to office council chairmen sacked  by a subsisting court Judgment using a different court decision, which has no consequential order.Let me make it clear that the said Council Chairmen were sacked before I was sworn in as governor of Osun State, contrary to the lies being peddled, that the Chairmen and councilors were sacked by my Executive Order.For emphasis, l want to state that I had nothing to do with the sacking of the chairmen and councilors produced by the Osun 2022 local government polls.</english> <english>The Chairmen and Councilors were sacked by two different judgments of the Federal High Court Osogbo.The script Mr Oyetola is playing is about the most reprehensible abuse of power in this fourth republic capable of untold and unforeseen consequences on the polity.The general public is aware that there were two different Federal  High Court judgments on the local government election of 2022.</english> <english>The first judgment was on the suit filed by the People Democratic Party (PDP) which sacked the product of the 2022 polls.</english> <english>The second judgment was on the suit filed by the Action People Party (APP), which also sacked the Chairmen and Councillors produced by the said 2022 Osun Local Government polls.The APC appeal against the judgment obtained by the PDP was partially successful, and the said judgment was struck out  based on the timing of filing, having been filed before the notice of election was published.It needs to be emphasized that the judgment contains no consequential orders.The APC in its amended notice of Appeal, asked the Court of Appeal to reinstate the sacked chairmen and councilors, but the Court of Appeal in its wisdom said it has become an academic exercise.</english> <english>The request for the reinstatement of the Chairmen and Councilors was not granted.However, the Appeal by the APC against the APP judgment did not succeed at the Court of Appeal, which makes the judgment still subsisting and alive.The Court of Appeal dismissed the APC appeal against the judgment obtained by the APP.</english> <english>The only legal recourse open to the APC is to appeal the APP judgment and the subsequent rulings of the Court of Appeal to the Supreme Court.The Certified True Copies of both judgements had earlier been forwarded to the Osun state Commissioner of Police, the State Director of DSS and the state Commandant of Civil Defense by the Osun state Attorney General for their information and records.The Certified True Copies of  both judgments are in the public domain.</english> <english>The judgment of the Court of Appeal on the PDP case was not ambiguous whatsoever.</english> <english>It simply struck out the PDP suit and did not in any of its paragraphs order the reinstatement of the sacked council chairmen and Councilors.It is very clear that no consequential order was made because the APP case is still subsisting.</english> <english>As I stated earlier, the Court of Appeal said that the request for the reinstatement of the Chairmen and Councilors has become an academic exercise.We call on legal luminaries and the Nigerian Bar Association  to fact check our claims by reading and interpreting the judgments.</english> <english>Even a layman can comprehend the meaning except those with an agenda to destroy the peace and progress of Osun state.In a democratic society governed by the rule of  law, we all must submit to the law.</english> <english>If we are dissatisfied with the outcome of a court process, we can appeal to the next court to end at the Supreme Court.</english> <english>If you are not sure of the meaning and intent of a court judgment, the system expects you to apply for interpretation again through the court system.It is illegal, unconstitutional, and anti-democratic to take the law into your own hands.</english> <english>For a serving minister, the person of Mr Gboyega Oyetola to lead the charge to violate the constitution and foment violence over a judicial process is not only shameful but is sadism and treason taken too far.We have it on good authority that  Mr Gboyega Oyetola  has instructed the Osun state Commissioner of Police,  the state Director of the DSS and the state Commandant of civil defence corps to mobilise security operatives from within Osun to effect the non existent judgement by forcefully taking over the local governments on Monday.Mr Oyetola and the police boss have been holding a series of meetings on how to effect the illegal operations.We affirm that Mr Gboyega Oyetola has no constitutional authority to issue directives to the security agencies.The fact that Mr Oyetola is nephew of Mr.</english> <english>President does not confer any such authority on him.We see this as a gross betrayal  of trust reposed in the Osun state security officers by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.I want to state that the current nefarious activities of Mr Oyetola and bosses of Osun security agencies constitute grave incitement.</english> <english>These need to stop because we are  neither  interested in resorting to self-help nor in support of violence to resolve political matters.</english> <english>As much as we are law-abiding people, we are fierce protectors of our rights, at night and by the day.I want to place on notice the Nigerian Public, and our friends in the diplomatic community and the lovers of democracy and rule of law that our people will not accept any attempt to impose illegality and anarchy on us.We will not allow any takeover of the local government except through a judicial pronouncement or a democratic process.We vehemently reject any ploy to deploy a non-existing court order to achieve local political power.I therefore appeal to  Mr President who is a renown democrat to insist on the rule of law by instructing the Inspector General of Police, the Director General of DSS, the Commandant General of the Civil Defense Corps not to obey an illegal  order from his nephew, Mr Gboyega Oyetola.</english> <english>The Osun State security chiefs should also be called to order.I call on Mr President, to instruct the National Security Adviser, and the Attorney General of the Federation, to personally verify the fact that the Court of Appeal judgement did not reinstate the sacked local government chairmen and councilors and the fact that, there is a subsisting judgement of Court that sacked the Chairmen and Councillors  produced by the 2022 local government polls.The Nigerian public should hold Mr Gboyega Oyetola and the Osun state security chiefs responsible for any breakdown of law and order in the state tomorrow, Monday, and beyond.It is unfortunate that the Osun state security chiefs are taking instructions from Mr Gboyega Oyetola just because he is the nephew of Mr.</english> <english>President.As much as we will do our best to maintain peace, we call on men and women of goodwill to intervene before it is too late.I thank you for listening</english>

<english>If that's the case, tame him.</english> <english>You're the CSO of the state.</english> <english>Oyetola was a total failure when he held sway as governor of the State, he has no business with governance and must not distort or disrupt peace in our dear state.</english>
<english>If that's the case, tame him.</english> <english>You're the CSO of the state.</english> <english>Oyetola was a total failure when he held sway as governor of the State, he has no business with governance and must not distort or disrupt peace in our dear state.CSO of the state?CSO who doesnTMt have the control of the IGP?</english>
<english>Oyetola failed woefully as governor and is currently failing abysmally as the minister of the blue economy.</english> <english>ThatTMs the kind of individual Tinubu is using to cause chaos and foment trouble in Osun StateThunder  Tinubu</english>

<pidgin>So make Tinubu go flog his Nephew or draw his ears?</pidgin>
<pidgin>Mr Governor..Obey court order na"It is very clear that no consequential order was made because the APP case is still subsisting.</pidgin> <english>As I stated earlier,the Court of Appeal said that the request for the reinstatement of the Chairmen and Councilors has become an academic exercise."Has their tenure endedHow can it be an academic exercisePoliticians will just find one grammar to suit their narrative</english>
<english>2027 is here already.</english>
<english>You know what is funny?I thought about someone reporting Davido to this man then I went to check the age of Oyetola.</english> <english>It is possible to have a nephew who is your mate but the minister and Tinubu are just 2 years apart.</english> <english>The Governor is somehow cheeky for reminding us that they are nephews, it has a political undertone</english>
<english>Ok, over to President Tinubu.</english>

<english>Yesterday, Sowore posted a video showing a mild drama that occurred during the Lagos State 2025 Marathon between him and Sanwo-OluTMs men.</english> <english>He shared the video on his X handle, formerly known as Twitter, with the "How occupying a canopy after the Lagos Marathon 10k infuriated some rogue elements who assaulted our crew members and journalists, leading to unprovoked attacks, which led to the seizure of a camera belonging to one of our journalists.</english> <english>They insisted on viewing and deleting all the content because it caught them live attacking our crew in Lagos."However, Punch newspaper reported today that the Take It Back (TIB) Movement has condemned what it described as a disgraceful attack on its leader, Omoyele Sowore, and movement members during SaturdayTMs Access Bank Lagos City Marathon.According to a statement issued on Saturday by the Director-General of TIB Global, Sowore and his team participated in the 10km race but were met with violence and harassment at the finish line in Eko Atlantic.The statement alleged that thugs, reportedly sponsored by the Lagos State Government, assaulted Sowore and his team, including members of the press."After crossing the finish line, Sowore and his comrades returned to the tents provided for participants, where they sat to address the media, including a Daily Trust reporter who had followed them throughout the race," the statement read.The movement claimed that some individuals approached them, insisting that the space was designated for government dignitaries and that they should vacate the area.Sowore reportedly questioned this assertion, challenging why non-participants were given priority over those who had completed the race.A team member assured the coordinators that they would only be there temporarily while waiting for other team members, after which they left.TIB alleged that about 10 minutes later, a group of thugs launched an unprovoked attack on Sowore, his team, and members of the press."The media crew covering the event was not spared, as they were also harassed and assaulted," the statement alleged.According to TIB, the attackers targeted their equipment, forcibly seizing a camera belonging to a media crew member named Happiness."Her camera was forcefully taken in an attempt to delete footage of the attack," the group stated, adding that as of the time of the statement, the camera had not been returned.In response, TIB demanded immediate action from the Lagos State Government and marathon organizers."We demand the immediate return of the stolen camera and footage, as well as a public apology from the marathon organizers for their complicity in this politically motivated aggression," the statement read.TIB highlighted that Sowore has participated in at least four editions of the Lagos City Marathon and described the attack as an affront to the principles of sportsmanship.As of press time, neither the Lagos State Government nor the organizers of the marathon had responded to the allegations.Sowore was attacked in Lagos by thugs alongside crew members of his media outfit while participating in the marathon.The Access Bank Lagos City Marathon is one of NigeriaTMs most prestigious road races, attracting elite athletes, casual runners, and government dignitaries.</english>

<english>The Asagba of Asaba in Delta State, HRM Obi Prof.</english> <english>Epiphany Azinge SAN, has banned the activities of  Eze-NwanyiTM (female native doctors/goddesses) and other unregulated traditional practitioners.The decision comes amid concerns that these groups are fueling criminal activities, including kidnappings and ritual-related crimes.The palace maintained it was a decisive move to curb rising crime in Asaba and its environs.The announcement follows reports linking native doctors and shrines in Asaba to the murder of an Anambra lawmaker, Justice Azuka, whose body was discovered on the Niger Bridge.The Asagba, addressing a press conference, expressed grave concern over the situation, stating, Anything that happens on this land affects us more than anyone else.It is unacceptable that Asaba has become a hub for these nefarious activities.</english> <english>Consequently, we have decided to take proactive steps to restore peace and order.Ban on Female Native Doctors, Shrine RestrictionsThe monarch emphasised that many of these practitioners are not of Asaba origin and have taken over the land with criminal motives.We have banned the activities of Eze-Nwanyi, who are not of Asaba extraction and are unknown to us.</english> <pidgin>Their activities, I dare say, are nefarious.With the recent revelations linking an Anambra lawmakerTMs murder to Asaba-based native doctors and shrines, it is clear that they are not just supporting  Yahoo YahooTM fraudsters but are also involved in kidnappings.</pidgin> <english>From today, they are banned, he declared.Additionally, all native doctors operating in Asaba must now register and be regulated under the authority of the Otu-Ihaza, the legislative body of Asaba.The monarch also restricted visits to the Onishe shrine, citing desecration concerns.</english> <english>That place is being desecrated.</english> <english>People go there for all sorts of reasons.</english> <english>Henceforth, nobody, whether from Asaba or not, may visit the shrine without the approval of the Otu-Ihaza.Operation  Know Your TenantsHighlighting the rapid and unmonitored influx of strangers into Asaba, the Asagba introduced Operation Know Your Tenants, mandating landlords to document and keep an inventory of their tenants.We do not even know who lives in Asaba anymore.</english> <english>Criminals see Asaba as a safe haven.</english> <english>We are now declaring Operation Know Your Tenants.Every landlord must have proper documentation of their tenants so that at any time, we can account for who resides where, he added.The monarch urged property owners to cooperate, warning that security measures would be tightened to identify and expel criminal elements.Hotel SurveillanceFurther, the palace will deploy a special task force to hotels across Asaba to inspect guest records.We will be going round hotels to check their guest lists.</english> <english>The palace is already collaborating with security agencies to ensure that those using hotels for criminal hideouts are exposed, he asserted.The Asagba reaffirmed his support for government efforts in tackling insecurity but stressed that traditional institutions must also take an active role in protecting their communities.We stand with the government at all times, but there comes a moment when we must be more proactive.</english> <english>Asaba must not become a breeding ground for crime, he concluded.</english>
<pidgin>Asagba was being diplomatic not to mention names but no wahala..</pidgin> <pidgin>If Soludo could be putting fire under their yansh in Anambra, why won't the same be done in Delta where they are running to hide.</pidgin> <english>In summary, the Asagba says he doesn't want development in his environment anymore.</english> <english>This is what you get when your only export value is criminality.</english>
